[Translation] 
HON. SPEAKER: Two Members are remaining. I am not calling out their names right now due to some reason. The House was running smoothly in the last two days  and today the proceedings have been completed. I want to thank you all.  
It appeared to me that the smell of elections still hangs in the air of the two  day long programme that concluded post elections. Our two presiding officers of the  17th Lok Sabha sitting here repeatedly raised their concern that it was against the  convention. But I would request that now that the election fever is gone, the actual  proceedings of the House will start tomorrow. Everything except the oath and 
32 
affirmation has been expunged from the record. Earlier also instructions were given  to blur all things spoken on the mic from here, in the audio and video. We could hear  them but not others and even if it exists it needs to be expunged.  
The House stands adjourned till 11am tomorrow, Wednesday, June 26, 2024. 18.04 hrs 
The Lok Sabha then adjourned till Eleven of the Clock on  
Wednesday, June 26, 2024/Ashadha 5, 1946 (Saka).
