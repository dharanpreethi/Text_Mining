"Karan Johar reunited with his Lust Stories star Kiara Advani in a new series of advertisements for an eyewear brand. After one commercial in which Kiara play-acted as Karan, going around asking people if theyâ€™re dating, a new spot shows Karan channeling his inner Rajinikanth. In the ad, Karan and Kiara are both dressed like a quintessential Rajinikanth character, wearing shirts, vests, and aviator sunglasses.
Karan seems to be having the time of his life delivering the broad performance. One of the most recognisable filmmakers of the country, Karan made a full-fledged acting debut with Anurag Kashyapâ€™s ill-fated 2015 gangster drama Bombay Velvet. He has since joked multiple times about how the movieâ€™s critical and commercial failure killed his acting ambitions. In the new ad, Karan adopts â€˜the south Indian superstar lookâ€™, and immediately transforms into a dialogue-delivering, scenery chewing showboat.

â€œNgl, the actor within me is so impressed,â€ he wrote in the caption of his Instagram post, sharing the new commercial. â€œWooohooo superb,â€ wrote actor Nandish Sandhu in the comments section. â€œWoww awesome,â€ another person commented. Last year, Karan collaborated with Lenskart for a series of ads featuring founder Peyush Bansal. The ads were conceptualised by Tanmay Bhat, Devaiah Bopanna, Deep Joshi, and Vishal Dayama.
Karan and Kiara have worked together on Lust Stories, Good Newwz, and Shershaah. She also appeared on the recently concluded eighth season of his talk show, Koffee with Karan.

"Filmmaker Karan Johar declared the the concept of superstardom will cease to exist in the generations that have followed that of the three Khans â€“ Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan and Aamir Khan. He said in an interview that he is biased towards his old friend Shah Rukh, as he described his â€˜irreplaceableâ€™ personality. Shah Rukh delivered the three biggest hits of his career in the same calendar year in 2023, reclaiming his position as the countryâ€™s biggest star.
Karan has often spoken about the kind of allure that movie stars used to have, and told Forbes that he finds this quality lacking in the actors that have followed. He said, â€œThere is no concept, according to me, of superstardom post the era of Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan. I feel now thereâ€™ll be the age of the actors.â€

Karan said that the idea of celebrity has also evolved, because there are so many different ways in which one can become popular these days. â€œAt one point, celebrity meant a movie star or cricketer. But today, a celebrity can be an Instagrammer or a food vlogger, a fashion influencer or a great author. The lines have blurred. But the nationâ€™s crazy love for Shah Rukh, Salman Aamir, Hrithik Roshan, Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgnâ€¦ Even Kareena Kapoor, Rani Mukerji, Kajolâ€¦ When Rani and Kajol came on Koffee with Karan, I could tell the equity they carried because they come from a legacy of 25 years.â€
Karan added, â€œEven now, when Rekha walks into an event, heads turn. Thatâ€™s a movie star. When Aishwarya walks the red carpet at Cannes, when Mr Bachchan is anywhere, theyâ€™re movie stars. That mania, that magic is very tough to create in this generation of noise.â€ Highlighting Shah Rukh, Karan declared, â€œI donâ€™t think thereâ€™s a better conversationalist, a more intelligent mind, a more charming and arresting persona, and an aura that is inexplicable than Shah Rukh Khan. That majestic magnetism only he has. Heâ€™s irreplaceable.â€
Karan said that there will be â€˜many actorsâ€™ in the future, but â€˜there never was and never will be a personality like Shah Rukh Khanâ€™. Karan and Shah Rukh have worked together on films such as Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, and My Name is Khan.

"Ever since Divya Agarwal and Varun Sood parted ways, Divya has been vocal in several interviews, sharing her side of the story. On the other hand, Varun has kept a low profile and hasnâ€™t spoken much on the matter. Currently gearing up for his OTT release Karmma Calling with Raveena Tandon, Varun was questioned about how he handles moving on from situations in life and whether itâ€™s easy for him.
In an interview with Siddharth Kanna, Varun was asked about moving on. He said, â€œI think moving on is a bit difficult. But I can forgive thinking that what happened might have been destined. You canâ€™t feel bad about â€˜Oh, this happened to me.â€™ If something bad has happened to you, then leave it to fate and karma.â€
He continued, â€œI think I am naive but I am not street smart is not right, because I am. Being an outsider, I have figured out things on my own. But yes, I am naive; I believe people easily. For me, everybody is a nice person. If I am meeting someone for the first time, I would like to believe that they are a good person.â€

Divya had revealed the reason behind their break-up on Amrita Rao and RJ Anmolâ€™s podcast. She said, â€œWith Varun, I felt all over the place. With Apurva, I would feel calm and mature. I made Varun meet Apurva. I told him clearly that I had a problem. I had a confusion. Whatever has happened is very wrong and it has happened because of me. I need to put a stop somewhere. And thatâ€™s why it was an abrupt break-up. I just got the car to a screeching halt.â€ The couple announced their break-up in March 2022. Divya is now engaged to entrepreneur Apurva Padgaonkar. "
"On Tuesday (Day 5), Mahesh Babuâ€™s latest release Guntur Kaaram crossed the Rs 150 crore mark worldwide, and on Day 6, it breached the Rs 100-crore mark on home ground. According to Sacnilk, the film has earned Rs 100.95 crore from Indian box offices. However, with the Sankranti holiday season coming to a close, footfalls have dropped by more than 30 percent. On Day 5, the box office collection of the film was around Rs 11 crore, which has come down to Rs 6 crore on Day 6. The slide is expected to continue till the weekend.

The film is also facing tough competition from HanuMan, starring Teja Sajja, which on Day 6 has earned around Rs 80 crore, a huge number given the relatively new star cast.
Guntur Kaaram marks the third collaboration of Mahesh Babu and director Trivikram Srinivas, who have earlier made blockbusters like Athadu and Businessman. While the previous ventures became milestones in Mahesh Babuâ€™s career, Guntur Kaaram falls short of creating such a legacy despite the considerable success at the box office.

Anandu Suresh of Indian Express rated the film two stars, and wrote, â€œMahesh Babu, in top-notch form, is the sole redeeming factor in Trivikramâ€™s unnecessarily stretched Guntur Kaaram, preventing it from becoming a tedious watch.â€
Also starring Sreeleela, Meenakshi Chaudhry, Ramya Krishnan, Jayaram, Prakash Raj, and Jagapati Babu in important roles. S Thaman has composed music for the film, with cinematography by Manoj Paramahamsa and Nirav Shah.
Mahesh Babu is next teaming up with SS Rajamouli for an untitled film, which is the next biggest collaboration in Telugu cinema."
"Filmmaker Karan Johar opened up about the return to form that theatrical Hindi films experienced in 2023, and dissected the new learnings that the industry is taking a stock of as it evolves. Karan said that the sort of films that would do very well in the 1990s donâ€™t really have an audience in theatres any more, but highlighted outliers like 12th Fail, the drama film that defied the odds to emerge as a word-of-mouth success late last year.
In an interview with Forbes, Karan was asked about how he views the business, and he said, â€œTheatres are overflowing with love, and the cinematic experience is back. But the digital medium is equally strong, and the digital revolution remains. This isnâ€™t the rule, but there are some genres and sub-genres that are more celluloid friendly.â€
Also read â€“ Karan Johar breaks down economics of cinema, reveals the business model he follows, says OTT platforms prefer â€˜licensed filmsâ€™ over originals

Citing the example of an exception to the norm, Karan continued, â€œ12th Fail just passed the test with flying colours. To anybodyâ€™s mind, that might have seemed like a great digital film, but it turned out to be a solid commercial success. Well done to the team and to Vinod Chopra, whoâ€™s such a veteran.â€ He added, â€œThe tent pole films, the big cinematic experiences are more for the cinemas. And genres like dramedies or family comedies, or suspense thrillers are more tough to sell theatrically. The films that defined our 90s and early 2000s, those films are not easy to sell today.â€ Recently, the creative head of Karanâ€™s Dharma Productions, Somen Mishra, chose to criticise 12th Fail director Vidhu Vinod Chopra for not crediting his writers appropriately.
This is why, Karan said, there are a lot of crime thrillers and romantic comedies being made for streaming platforms. â€œThere is a clear divide, but there will always be exceptions to that rule,â€ Karan said. Asked if the industry has become more data driven, Karan said, â€œWe have research models, we also have organisations like Ormax that predict opening numbers. You can get an indication, but thereâ€™s always that magic that you canâ€™t predict.â€
Karan admitted that filmmakers tell him not to rob them of their instincts, but his response is to remind them that they arenâ€™t in it alone, and have a responsibility to the person footing the bills. â€œItâ€™s not your money in the game. We are a balance of commerce and art. If you make a film for yourself, with your passion and your desire to tell a story, do it, but please do it with your own money,â€ he said.

"Alia Bhatt is known as one of the best actors of her generation and in a recent interview, cinematographer Sudeep Chatterjee spoke about his collaboration with Alia in Sanjay Leela Bhansaliâ€™s Gangubai Kathiawadi. Sudeep said that cinematographers have to form a relationship with the actors so they can get the best out of a given scene. He recalled that while shooting a scene for Gangubai Kathiawadi, he could not decipher if Alia had even heard his instructions as she did not react at all but her performance said otherwise.
He shared with Film Companion, â€œWith Alia, when I give her an instructionâ€¦ Initially, I used to say that there is no response. I wouldnâ€™t know whether she has heard me or not. But she would do it to the point.â€ He then recalled a scene from the film where Seema Pahwaâ€™s Sheela is performing with Aliaâ€™s Gangubai and is trying to suck her into her brothel.
â€œThere was one sequence where she is being trapped into the brothel and Sheela mausi is holding her face. I left a small slit of sunlight on her face. The light is almost a symbolism of her hope, her dignity, her pride, everything. And she would really want to cling on to that. In my mind, she would try to move towards the light and Sheela mausi would keep on dragging her to the darkness,â€ he shared.

Sudeep said that he wondered if he should share this with Alia so she could move her face accordingly and they could achieve the desired effect. â€œI thought maybe if I tell this to her, and it was early in the shoot, I said if I tell this to her, she can help me in achieving this. When I told her, I didnâ€™t realise that she had even realised what I had said and sheâ€¦ But you see that scene and see what she does. Then after the take, she came and asked me that â€˜could I manage?â€™ I was so happy,â€ he said.
Alia Bhatt was widely praised for her work in Gangubai Kathiawadi. The actor will next be seen in Vasan Balaâ€™s next Jigra.

"Orry, who has been an internet sensation for most of 2023, recently solidified his stardom as he appeared on the last episode of Koffee with Karan with Karan Johar. Orry, who is frequently photographed with Kajol and Ajay Devgnâ€™s daughter Nysa Devgn, recalled his first encounter with Kajol when the film star refused to have a photo with him.
Orry shared that many years ago, when he was still living as a student in New York, he managed to â€˜hustleâ€™ his way into the position of an usher for an event which was being attended by Kajol. â€œI was usher number 3 to Kajol and she probably doesnâ€™t know this. This was in New York at the Taj Pierre, she was speaking at it and she kept talking about how children should wash their hands. This was pre-Covid and she was giving this speech,â€ he said.

During his appearance on the episode, Orry spoke about his â€™15 minutes of fameâ€™ and said he is now planning his â€˜downfallâ€™. â€œYes, the fame is getting to my head. Yes, I have an attitude problem. I think Iâ€™m better than everyone. But I am planning my own downfall now. Anything that goes up must go down, the brightest stars burn the fastest,â€ he said and added, â€œThen, the 15 minutes will be up. And then, weâ€™ll plan a comeback. Karan, in a movie, every lead goes up, and then they have to have a fall, and then they have a comeback. My fall is coming.â€

"Actor Samantha Ruth Prabhu took to her Instagram handle and engaged with her fans by answering a few questions. The Family Man actor opened up about â€˜personal growthâ€™ and discussed the most â€˜significant mistakeâ€™ of her life. Samantha admitted that her choices were influenced by her ex-partner, and she struggled to figure out her true likes and dislikes. The actor was previously married to Naga Chaitanya.
Samantha penned a long and thoughtful reply to the question which read, â€œIf personal growth had a highlight reel, what would be the â€˜blooperâ€™ you laugh about now, and whatâ€™s the â€˜Oscar-worthyâ€™ moment where you nailed a major life lesson?â€
She replied, â€œPerhaps the most significant mistake was my failure to understand my own likes and dislikes, as they were constantly influenced by the partner I had during that period. On the other hand, my moment of immense personal growth occurred when I recognized that even during the most difficult times, there was a valuable lesson to be learnt.â€
Naga Chaitanya and Samantha dated for four years before getting married in 2017. However, the couple announced their separation in 2021. The ex-couple had said in a statement, â€œAfter much deliberation and thought Sam and I have decided to part ways as husband and wife to pursue our own paths.

Appearing on the season eight finale of Koffee with Karan, Orry opened up about his fame, and how he plans on circumventing any loss of relevance.
He said that he is able to be â€˜omnipresentâ€™ because he actually has three doppelgangers that he deploys to hold the fort at events until he arrives himself. He said, â€œI am everywhere, and I take great pride in being Orry the omnipresent. But sometimes, people forget that Iâ€™m not actually a mystical creature, and I canâ€™t actually be everywhere. So, we do have the lookalikes that have to be sent out to hold the fort until I arrive. So, there will be an Orry lookalike whoâ€™ll be at the event, and youâ€™ll think itâ€™s me for the first 20 minutes, till I actually get from Nariman Point to BKCâ€¦ We all wear the same outfit, we have the same look.

Orry continued, â€œI was so shy, I was shaking. I told him, â€˜Boney uncle, they were calling my nameâ€™. And he was like, â€˜Did you pose?â€™ And I said I didnâ€™t. He grabbed me by the wrist and flung me in front of the media, and said, â€˜Yeh Orry hai, iska photo lo, yeh mera bachcha hai (This is Orry, heâ€™s like my son, take his picture)â€™. The match was always there, and so was the gunpowder, and Boney just lit it. And now Iâ€™m on Koffee, so I should write him a cheque.â€ Karan joked that Boney would probably like it.

She will be next seen in Stree 2, the sequel to her hit 2018 film which Amar-Kaushik directed. The film is scheduled to release in theatres in August 2024.

"The Bigg Boss 17 house was in chaos last night amid the friction between Vicky Jain and Munawar Faruqui, which escalated to include other contestants including Mannara Chopra and Ankita Lokhande. The unpleasantness began with the torture task in the house this week for the nomination process. When Munawar took something that belonged to Vicky, Ankita Lokhandeâ€˜s husband lost his cool and the argument began. It was during this fight that Ankita hurled abuses at Mannara Chopra, leaving fans upset.
This incident also led to a debate on the internet, where users were seen questioning Ankita for being the â€˜sanskari bahuâ€™ on Indian television and using bad language on the show. A video that surfaced online, shows Ankita getting angry on Munawar and when Mannara jumped in to defend him, Ankita yelled an abuse at her.

"The eighth season of Koffee with Karan came to an end this week and in the last episode of this season, Karan hosted Sumukhi Suresh, Kusha Kapila, Danish Sait and Tanmay Bhat as he gave out the Koffee awards of the season. The guests were also the jury for the Koffee awards where they voted on some of the best moments and performances of the season. Karan casually admitted that he is Poo while giving out the â€˜best momentâ€™ award from this season to Rani Mukerji and Kajol.
The rapid fire round, thatâ€™s often seen as the most entertaining bit of the episode, was one of the award categories and the â€˜Best rapid fireâ€™ was shared by two celebrities â€“ Saif Ali Khan and Ananya Panday. He called Ananya who was rather surprised as she did not win the rapid fire round during her episode with Sara Ali Khan. â€œIâ€™d like to thank a certain â€˜boy Kapurâ€™ for that,â€ she said.

"Internet sensation Orry appeared as a guest on the final episode of the eighth season of Koffee with Karan, where he revealed that he is fully aware of how fickle fame can be. Orry said that he is pre-empting his loss of relevance, and is currently in the process of planning own digital â€˜demiseâ€™. He said that like the hero of a movie, he will rise up from the ashes in a strategic manner.
To help him plan his life, Orry said, he has a team of â€˜minionsâ€™ who work in the â€˜relevance roomâ€™ at the â€˜Orry officeâ€™. Asked if he fears that what heâ€™s currently experiencing might just be his â€™15 minutes of fameâ€™, Orry said that not only is he aware, he is also taking the necessary steps to combat it. â€œYes, the fame is getting to my head. Yes, I have an attitude problem. I think Iâ€™m better than everyone. But I am planning my own downfall now. Anything that goes up must go down, the brightest stars burn the fastest,â€ he said.

"A debut film (Aparan) still hailed as one of the finest mystery thrillers in Malayalam; a filmography filled with numerous blockbusters; several movies revisited by countless viewers to this day; a skilled master in handling slapstick, situational and physical comedy with impeccable timing and exceptional dialogue delivery. Yet, Jayaram stands out as one of the rare Malayalam superstars whose career took a significant downturn at one point.
Facing consecutive box office failures in the last decade, each of which was panned by both audiences and critics alike, Jayaram became one of those actors one could not bet on. From starring in around 10-15 films annually, with most enjoying success, Jayaram hit rock bottom, experiencing no releases in Malayalam in 2020, 2021 or 2023 and just one film in 2022 (Sathyan Anthikadâ€™s Makal).

"While people were expecting Prabhas to do another mammoth project with a scope thatâ€™s as big as Salaar, the Telugu star took everyone by surprise as he announced a romantic horror-comedy with director Maruthi. Further, the poster of the film was revealed on Sankranthi, which had Prabhas in a casual look in a shirt and lungi. Since the recent update, fans have been wondering what the film is about, and the IMDb page of the movie has led to more frenzy as it features the plot line of the film.
The synopsis on the website reads, â€œIt revolves around a couple who fall in love but are set to change destiny due to a negative energy.â€ This has led to a lot of speculation among fans, but the filmâ€™s director has put an end to all such talks.

"Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck remember the feeling of being the new kids at the Sundance Film Festival. In 2004, theyâ€™d come to Park City, Utah, armed with a short film Gowanus, Brooklyn, some homemade promotional postcards and dreams of breaking through. Their short not only won a prize that year but also enough support to make the feature version, Half Nelson, which would later earn Ryan Gosling his first Oscar nomination.
â€œI remember being like, oh my God, this festival has been around 20 years, itâ€™s such an old festival,â€ Boden said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. â€œNow itâ€™s 20 years later and weâ€™re the old people.â€
Of course, â€œoldâ€ is relative when it comes to a discovery festival like Sundance, where directors fresh out of film school can get a shot at a breakthrough. Remember, Kevin Smith was just 23 when he brough Clerks to Park City. Like many of their contemporaries that started at Sundance â€” including Steven Soderbergh, who is also coming with a new film, Presence â€” Boden and Fleck have gone on to bigger projects, including Captain Marvel.

Their new film debuts Thursday, opening night of the 40th edition of the festival, at the storied Eccles Theater. Freaky Tales is a love letter to Fleckâ€™s hometown, Oakland, in the 1980s â€” its sports, music, history and the movies of the time â€” featuring Pedro Pascal, Jay Ellis, Dominique Thorne and Ben Mendelsohn.
â€œItâ€™s a movie loverâ€™s movie,â€ Boden teased. â€œIt has one foot in reality and then one foot just launches off into fantasy.â€
The first day also boasts the world premieres of several high-profile documentaries, including Jesse Moss and Amanda McBaineâ€™s Girls State, Yance Fordâ€™s Power and Frida, directed by Emmy-nominated editor Carla GutiÃ©rrez, and playing in the U.S. documentary competition.
As an immigrant and a former art student, GutiÃ©rrez has long admired Frida Kahlo. In Frida, she uses Kahloâ€™s words from her diary, letters and essays to let the artist tell her own story.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œUncovering her own words and her own voice, I think what weâ€™re presenting is a new way of getting into her world and in her mind and her heart and really understanding the art in a more intimate, raw way,â€ GutiÃ©rrez said.
Other anticipated documentaries playing across various sections include Daughters, about four young girls reuniting with their incarcerated fathers at a dance, Gaucho Gaucho, from The Truffle Hunters filmmakers, Sue Bird: In the Clutch, DEVO, Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story, Seeking Mavis Beacon, and The Greatest Night in Pop, featuring never-before-seen footage about the making of We Are The World. The programmers are also predicting that Will & Harper, about a road trip Will Ferrell takes with his friend of 30 years who has come out as a trans woman, will be a big crowd pleaser.
As always, an army of celebrities are expected to descend on Park City, including Kristen Stewart, with two buzzy films (Love Me and Love Lies Bleeding), Saoirse Ronan, Kieran Culkin, Sebastian Stan, Glen Powell, Woody Harrelson, Steven Yeun, Lucy Liu, Danielle Deadwyler, Aubrey Plaza, Melissa Barrera and Laura Linney.
Chiwetel Ejiofor is also bringing his sophomore feature, Rob Peace, a biographical drama about the tragically short life of a brilliant kid from East Orange, New Jersey, which he wrote, directed and co-stars in alongside Jay Will, Mary J. Blige and Camila Cabello.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œIâ€™ve been fortunate to be there many times as an actor and a director as well,â€ Ejiofor said. â€œItâ€™s a dream to take this film there as well. Itâ€™s an American story, itâ€™s an independent film and it wants to sit in that world.â€
Sundance programmers culled through 17,435 submissions to arrive at the 83 feature films playing across the 10 days, featuring a diverse mix of behind-the-camera talent. There are new episodic projects from Debra Granik and Richard Linklater, as well as 31 feature debuts.
GutiÃ©rrez is one of those first-time directors, as is Titus Kaphar, an acclaimed contemporary artist and MacArthur Fellow who is making his narrative debut with the competition title Exhibiting Forgiveness. Featuring AndrÃ© Holland and Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, Kaphar uses his own paintings to tell this very personal story of an artist who is visited by his estranged father (John Earl Jelks). He wanted to find a way to talk to his children about his life experience and examine generational trauma in a new medium, and heâ€™s honored to have the festivalâ€™s support.
â€œMy favorite films are Sundance films,â€ Kaphar said. â€œTo be allowed into this new community of artists, a community of directors and filmmakers â€¦ itâ€™s pretty extraordinary.â€

The excitement isnâ€™t lost on Sundance mainstays like Jesse Eisenberg, who has been going to the festival since The Squid and the Whale. This year, heâ€™s bringing a film that heâ€™s been wanting to make for almost as long. In A Real Pain, which he wrote and directed, he plays an American who travels to Poland with his cousin (Culkin) to see where their late grandmother, a Holocaust survivor, was from.
â€œItâ€™s about how we kind of view modern pain versus historical pain, but not in a didactic way. I didnâ€™t want the movie to feel like homework,â€ Eisenberg said. â€œI wanted it to feel funny and light and only contemplative like that in retrospect.â€
And everyone has different ways of experiencing their films at Sundance. Boden and Fleck are especially looking forward to a â€œraucousâ€ crowd at the Eccles. Eisenberg will probably step out when the lights go down â€” he knows from experience that it makes him too anxious.
â€œMy nerves are a little redirected towards hoping people like it in a kind of holistic way, rather than just my acting,â€ said Eisenberg. He also appears in another highly anticipated film: Sasquatch Sunset, from David and Nathan Zellner, in which he and Riley Keough are unrecognizable as a family of, yes, sasquatches.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Robert Redford-founded festival is, mostly, forward thinking â€” but they are taking some time to appreciate the art that has come out of Sundance over four decades. Just take a look at the â€œall-time top 10â€ released Tuesday, voted on by more than 500 filmmakers, critics, and industry members. The list of classics includes: Joel and Ethan Coenâ€™s Blood Simple (10th), Soderberghâ€™s sex, lies and videotape (sixth), Jordan Peeleâ€™s Get Out (third) and Damien Chazelleâ€™s Whiplash (first).
The question now is what will pop from the 2024 festival. Will audiences see the next Before Sunrise, Memento, â€œY tu mamÃ¡ tambiÃ©n, Little Miss Sunshine, or Reservoir Dogs, and other films that have transcended their humble indie roots to become all-time classics? Will there be another Oscar nominee, or winner?
Festival director Eugene Hernandez noted a vibrancy in the lineup that reminded him of his earliest days going to the festival, in the 1990s.
â€œItâ€™s such a rich, rich combination of films that I that I think exhibit some really wild and adventurous creativity,â€ Hernandez said. â€œThat is really nourishing in a year when weâ€™re acknowledging and marking this 40th edition of Sundance.â€
The Sundance Film Festival runs from January 18 through January 28.

"Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Chak De India is still known as one of his best performances. The film by Shimit Amin is also considered to be one of the best sports films to be made in India. Sudeep Chatterjee, the cinematographer of the movie, in a recent interview spoke about the making of the film and how it was a challenge for him to make sure that the matches donâ€™t look like the audience is watching televised sports.
In a chat with Film Companion, Sudeep spoke about the scene after the Indian team wins the World Cup and the players rush on to the field, and and emotional Kabir Khan is standing on the edge on the field. â€œThat moment is actually a very sad moment because all the glory and the victory belongs to the girls and he is the one in the background, very few people will even know about his contribution. For me, that was the truth of the scene,â€ he said.

In an interview with indianexpress.com, when asked if he ever felt intimidated by the responsibility of the film, Teja replied, â€œNo, never. We have always thought about our culture, and our roots. Sitting back in Hyderabad, we have always wanted to make a Telugu film. After releasing the content, even if itâ€™s a Telugu film, we wanted it to look as grand as possible for our audience.â€

"Ad guru Prahlad Kakkar recalled a campaign that he spearheaded in the 1970s, which involved putting the comedic actor Paintalâ€˜s head literally inside a lionâ€™s mouth. Of course, the actor wasnâ€™t particularly excited to do this, but Prahlad narrated the story of how he got him to agree, and the darkly humorous interaction that he had with the client behind the campaign.
In a chat with Cyrus Broacha on the sidelines of the launch of his autobiography, one of Prahladâ€™s old colleagues brought up the lion story, and said, â€œI donâ€™t know if you remember this, but in 1977 or 78, you were doing an ad for Bush radios. Prahlad needed a guy to come and play with a lion, so Prahlad hires this lion, brings him into the studio, and makes him sit on a chair. And then he gets this comedian to talk to the lion, and he tells the comedian â€“ I canâ€™t remember his name â€“ that he has to put his head in the lionâ€™s mouth.â€

"Acclaimed filmmaker Vetrimaaran has opened up about the controversy surrounding Nayantharaâ€™s latest release Annapoorani. The film, which was released on Netflix after its theatrical run, was taken down by the OTT platform after it faced backlash from a few Hindu outfits. The OTT platform had said that the film was removed at â€˜licensorâ€™s requestâ€™. Now, the Tamil director said that the decision would undermine the authority of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC).

Speaking to the media in Chennai, the director was asked about Annapooraniâ€™s removal from the OTT platform, and the director said, â€œThere is no absolute freedom for directors in India without getting censored. This applies to OTT platforms too. Taking a film down due to external pressure will endanger the entire film industry.â€ He added, â€œOnly CBFC has the power to allow or stop a film. Such actions will only undermine the power of CBFC.â€

"Jimmy Shergill made his film debut with Maachis but it was his appearance in Aditya Chopraâ€™s Mohabbatein that made him a household name. Soon after the release of Mohabbatein, Jimmy started to get known for his boy-next-door charm but for him, he wanted to do more than appear in those â€˜chocolate boyâ€™ roles. In a recent interview, Jimmy said that he even returned the signing amount of a few producers because he wanted to take up varied projects instead of appearing in similar roles.
Jimmy said that even though people were telling him to capitalise on his charm, he wanted to move on because he could see that the same kind of roles wonâ€™t serve him for a long time. â€œAfter working a lot for the first two years, I returned the signing amount to a lot of people because I wanted to do something different. Because this chocolate boy thing was a little too much at the time. Everybody would say â€˜why? This is amazingâ€™ and I would say â€˜no, there is something inside me telling me that this wonâ€™t last for more than 2-3 yearsâ€™. So I knew that I needed to look forâ€¦ thatâ€™s where films like Munna Bhai, Haasil, Yahaan, these films came to me,â€ he shared with Bollywood Bubble and added, â€œThese gave a different image and never let you get stuck into one particular image.â€

While the famously tardy Govinda once showed up to work a full two days late, Prahlad recalled the shock that he got when he walked onto set one morning, to find Amitabh Bachchan quietly reading a newspaper as he waited for the crew to arrive.
In an interaction with Cyrus Broacha, Prahlad described this as â€˜the most traumaticâ€™ experience, and said that the next time he worked with the actor, nobody slept the night before. â€œOur most traumatic moments were with Mr Bachchan. He has a habit of coming five minutes early, with full makeup. No film unit in the world turns up five minutes early, or even on time.â€

"Ad guru Prahlad Kakkar has worked with celebrities of all kinds through the course of his career, and in a new interview, he recalled his experience working with actor Govinda, who was at the peak of the Bollywood pyramid in the â€™90s. Prahlad recalled Govindaâ€™s famous tardiness, and said that the actor once assured him that heâ€™d make it in time for a shoot even though he was thousands of miles away.
Chatting with Cyrus Broacha on the sidelines of the launch of his autobiography, Prahlad recalled anecdotes about everyone from Sachin Tendulkar to Amitabh Bachchan. Asked about working with Bollywood actors, Prahlad said, â€œThey were all okay. Govinda came 24 hours late to the setâ€¦â€ A colleague of his corrected him, and said that Govinda was, in fact, a full two days late. Prahlad continued, â€œWe were on a big set in Hyderabad, of all the places. And he was supposed to come from Srinagar. He said, â€˜Donâ€™t worry, main time pe aa jaunga (Iâ€™ll be there on time)â€™. I said, â€˜Kaise ayega tu? Tera flight nahi hai (How? You donâ€™t even have a flight)â€™. He said, â€˜Gaadi mein baith ke aunga na (Iâ€™ll come in a car)â€™.

"Veteran actor Mumtaz is happy that female artists today have vanity vans and proper sanitation facilities on film sets, which was not the case back in the day. She also talked about her relationship with Bollywood actors like Waheeda Rehman and Vyjanthimala, and how actresses of her time didnâ€™t talk to the ones who they thought were â€˜inferiorâ€™ to them.
Recalling the time when she shot the Aap Ki Kasam (1974) song Jai Jai Shiv Shankar, Mumtaz told Dawn News, â€œFor miles and miles there were no bathrooms during the shoot of the song Jai Jai Shiv Shankar. So, if I had to use the washroom, I would take my hairdresser along in search of one. Now, they have air-conditioned rooms. People today are quite lucky to have everything. All of these facilities were not there in our times.â€

"Rajya Sabha MP and vice-president of the BCCI, Rajeev Shukla spoke about his friendship with Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan. In an interview, he recalled the advice that Shah Rukh gave him about giving acting a shot. He said that over the years, several filmmakers have approached him to play small roles in movies, but Shah Rukh once advised him to stick to what heâ€™s good at. He also narrated an anecdote about the late singer Lata Mangeshkar coming to the BCCIâ€™s rescue after the board was unable to pay members of the World Cup winning team of 1983.
Shukla spoke with YouTuber Samdish Bhatia for the Unfiltered by Samdish channel, where he was asked about his rolodex of famous friends, one of whom happens to be Shah Rukh. â€œA few directors have offered me roles, but I refused to do them. Itâ€™s not about liking or disliking the field of acting, but sometimes youâ€™re forced to fit into certain roles, and thereâ€™s no fun in doing them. Recently, another filmmaker offered me the role of a politician in their film, and I asked Shah Rukh about it. He said, â€˜Rajeev ji, that isnâ€™t your jobâ€™. Heâ€™s the biggest star we have, so of course Iâ€™d ask him. If heâ€™s ever offered to become an MP, heâ€™d ask me.â€

"Actor Raveena Tandon spoke about the career decline of her frequent co-star in the 1990s, Govinda, and said that the kind of movies for which heâ€™s perfectly suited arenâ€™t being made any more. She said that she maintains a friendship with Govinda, and praised him as being the most talented actor of his generation. Govinda has experienced a drastic decline in stardom in the last decade, and has often implied that there is a conspiracy afoot to harm his career.
In an interview with The Lallantop, Raveena was asked about her streak of hits with Govinda, called Chi Chi by his friends, and his apparent fall from grace. Pushing back on the suggestion, she said, â€œThe kind of films where Chi Chiâ€™s talent can be perfectly used arenâ€™t being made any more. I donâ€™t think this industry has ever seen an actor as talented as Chi Chi. I have never seen an actor who can make the audience laugh and cry in the same scene. I was in awe of him. He could transform a comedic scene into an emotional one so effortlessly. Everything I know about comic timing Iâ€™ve learned from him. Nobody can compare to him.â€

"Writer-lyricist Javed Akhtar broke misconceptions around Hindi and Urdu, and said at an event that it would be incorrect to assume that one is the language of Hindus and the other of Muslims. He said that language emerges from region not religion, and that Urdu is as much a Hindustani language as Hindi. He also said that it is unfair to blame governments over the years for the erasure of the Urdu script, because the people who are consider themselves to be the custodians of their culture havenâ€™t done their part in imparting this knowledge to younger generations.
Javed Akhtar appeared for a discussion about Hindi and Urdu being â€œSiamese twinsâ€ at the India International Centre, shared on the foundationâ€™s YouTube channel. â€œHindi and Urdu were equals until about 200 years ago, when, for political reasons, they were separated,â€ he said. â€œYou would not be able to tell if certain poems were written by a Hindi poet or an Urdu poet. This was done by the Britishers to create a cultural difference in north India.â€

However, in the latest episode of the TV reality show, the fight between the couple went out of control as Vicky reminded Ankita of how he stood by her when she was going through a tough time following her ex-boyfriend, actor Sushant Singh Rajputâ€™s death.
In the episode we saw Ankita confronting Vicky for not â€œspending enough timeâ€ with her and Vicky retorted, â€œIt was such a huge matter about Sushant, I was there by your side. I never came in between, you wanted to give interviews, and I had no problem with that. I used to sit with you and write things for you on how you should handle these interviews and everything. I have always stood by you. I didnâ€™t let anyone question you. Here, you are constantly reacting to everything that I do.â€

"Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga, who recently experienced the biggest success of his career with his controversial film Animal, said that the film industry is hostile towards outsiders like himself. Citing the example of awards shows, Vanga said that the industry is more interested in promoting its own rather than welcoming outsiders with fresh ideas. Starring Ranbir Kapoor, Bobby Deol, Rashmika Mandanna and Anil Kapoor, Animal was released in theatres last month.
In an interview with Dainik Bhaskar, Vanga said that he doesnâ€™t want to sound like heâ€™s complaining too much, which is why he has chosen to remain quiet about the things he has experienced in the industry. â€œItâ€™s literally like animal behaviour, you rebel against anybody who threatens to enter your territory,â€ he said.

"Katrina Kaif and Vijay Sethupathi-starrer Merry Christmas has turned out to be a slow earner. Even after very positive review by film critics and a positive word-of-mouth by the audience, the Sriram Raghavan directorial has been earning in single digits with lowest box office collection on Tuesday. According to industry tracking website Sacnilk, on day five of its release (Tuesday, January 16), the film minted Rs 1.15 crore nett in India in all languages. The total domestic collection of Merry Christmas stands at Rs 12.53 crore.
At the worldwide box office, the movie has managed to mint Rs 16 crore where Rs 2.5 crore are retained from overseas market while Rs 13.5 crore gross can be attributed to its domestic box office collection.
On Tuesday, the film witnessed a 10.25% Hindi occupancy. In Mumbai it has 342 shows running in cinemas with 10.75 percent occupancy, whereas in Delhi and NCR region there were 479 shows with 9.50 percent occupancy. The Vijay Sethupathi starrer is performing well in South Indian states. The film witnessed 26.04 percent Tamil occupancy even when very few shows of the film are running in cinemas. Chennai had only 61 shows running with 34.25 percent occupancy, Bangaluru with 14  shows had 15.75 occupancy and Kochi with the least number of shows (11) had an occupancy of 37.00 percent.
With no other major Hindi films running in cinemas, Merry Christmas will enjoy a free run in theatres until Pankaj Tripathiâ€™s Main Atal Hoon releases on January 19 and Deepika Padukone and Hrithik Roshanâ€™s Fighter, directed by Pathaan director Siddharth Anand will release on January 25. However, in South Indian states the film is facing a steep competition from films like HanuMan, which is performing extremely well in cinemas with it already earning Rs 100 crore internationally. Other films performing well in the south are Dhanushâ€™s Captain Miller, Sivakarthikeyanâ€™s Ayalaan, Mahesh Babuâ€™s Guntur Kaaram, Venkatesh Daggubatiâ€™s Saindhav and Nagarjunaâ€™s Naa Saami Ranga.

"The Telugu-language mythological superhero film HanuMan has overtaken Mahesh Babuâ€™s top dog, Guntur Kaaram, in terms of daily collections. Having opened to around a fifth of what Guntur Kaaram made on its first day of release, HanuMan has soared on the strength of positive word-of-mouth, despite having a smaller budget, no major stars, and a young director.
On its fifth day of release, HanuMan made Rs 12.75 crore, according to industry tracker Sacnilk. The film had opened to Rs 8 crore, but showed an improvement in collections during the weekend. On day four, a Monday, it actually made Rs 15 crore, marking a slight 5% decline from Sundayâ€™s Rs 16 crore collections. HanuManâ€™s overall domestic earnings now stand at Rs 68 crore, which means that it has a shot at hitting the Rs 100 crore mark domestically by Friday or Saturday.

"Dhanush, who was recently seen in Captain Miller, made his debut in Hindi movies way before the concept of pan-Indian films became big in India. Back in 2013, Dhanush played a lead role in Aanand L Raiâ€™s Raanjhanaa and while the actor was a force to be reckoned with in the Tamil industry, the Hindi film audience wasnâ€™t very familiar with his work. In a recent interview, Rai shared that his decision to cast Dhanush in the movie was met with some opposition as â€œpeople saw him as oddâ€. Primarily, this was because the northern part of the country saw heroes as having certain physical attributes and Dhanush did not fall in that category.
The filmmaker told Mashable India, â€œWe have an image for a hero which is slowly changing now. But at that time, in 2012-23â€¦ in the north, a 6 foot tall, fair boy was seen as a hero. That was the image. In such a world, Dhanush, who was a star in south, but here, people saw him as odd. But when you see him in the film and when he performs, there is no one more appealing than him.â€

"Comedians Pugazh and Kuraishi, who shot to fame through the reality game show Cooku with Comali on Vijay TV, are facing backlash from fans of Kamal Haasan for their comedy skit which allegedly was made in a bad taste. The comedians have apologised to fans for their video claiming that it was an honest mistake and never intended to hurt anyone.
A few months ago, Pugazh and Kuraishi performed at a cultural event in Dubai. During their performance, Kuraishi mimicked Haasan and answered questions posed by Pugazh. Every answer carried the word â€˜Mayaâ€™, which was a dig at the Tamil superstar. During Bigg Boss Tamil Season 7, Haasan faced criticism for siding with one of the contestants, Maya Krishnan. Maya had acted with Haasan in the film Vikram, and it was alleged that was the reason behind the actorâ€™s bias.

"When Shah Rukh Khan and director Aanand L Rai embarked on the journey of making Zero, it sounded like a near-impossible project that was demanding in its visual effects and was quite expensive. Yet, SRK made sure that he left no stone unturned in the making of the film. While the movie did not work at the box office, Aanand L Rai still remembers the time he spent with SRK fondly. In a recent chat with Mashable India, Rai said that as soon as he and SRK met, they were extremely giving towards each other and were doing everything for love.
When asked about the high budget of the film, Rai said that he â€œwould fight on thisâ€ and then shared with a laugh, â€œHe is a king and I would think so much moneyâ€¦ why?â€ In Zero, SRK played a vertically challenged man and at the time, the BTS footage of the film explained that to get every shot correctly, the makers had to shoot it five times over so they could accommodate the demands of the visual effects studio. The film was produced by SRKâ€™s Red Chillies Productions.

"Boman Irani, who was recently seen in Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Dunki, has been in the movies for over two decades now and has worked with every popular Bollywood actor. In a recent interview, Boman was asked about the questions he would want to ask movie stars and he came up with a few rather fascinating questions. For Shah Rukh Khan, Boman wondered how many hours does the man sleep as he has spent enough time working with King Khan but has never managed to solve that mystery.
â€œHow many hours do you sleep? Itâ€™s got to do with his energy and the fact that he wants to wake up and start the day with a bang. He is not much of a foodie. He is very into his tandoori chicken and he is happy, he is content. He doesnâ€™t think of fancy food as a way to make himself happy,â€ he told Connect FM Canada and added, â€œI have spent the whole night sitting and chatting with him. I am a mess the next morning, he is not. Itâ€™s amazing.â€

"Raveena Tandon, who will soon be seen in Disney+ Hotstarâ€™s upcoming web series Karmma Calling, has been promoting her show and in a recent interview, the actor spoke about the time when she worked with film producer Ram Gopal Varma in his film Shool. Raveena said that while RGV could not picture her in the film in the first place, he failed to recognise her when she was in costume.
Talking to Film Companion, Raveena said, â€œWhen we were shooting the promos, I got out of the make-up room and I went to stand in front of the camera. It was a long corridor from the make-up room to the set and I was crossing the corridor and Ramu crossed me.â€ Raveena said that when she greeted him, he looked at her but didnâ€™t respond which led her to believe that he was not happy with her casting in the film.

"In the realm of Malayalam cinema, where men predominantly held sway, Shakeelaâ€™s arrival in the â€™90s was akin to a heavy storm. Her rise to stardom disrupted conventional definitions and gender dynamics associated with the term. Primarily appearing in softcore pornographic films during the â€™90s and 2000s, Shakeela redefined the concept of a â€œheroineâ€ in Malayalam cinema by shattering its stereotypes.
Meanwhile, Shakeela recently remarked that the Malayalam film industry, which once made a brand out of her, was scared to cast her now. â€œNow they say that if they cast me, the film will be perceived differently,â€ she mentioned during a session titled â€˜The Myth of Moralityâ€™ at the seventh edition of the Kerala Literature Festival (KLF) in Kozhikode, The News Minute reported.

"Actor Ankita Lokhandeâ€™s mother, Vandana, addressed allegations that Ankita has been bringing up the late Sushant Singh Rajput on Bigg Boss to gain sympathy. Ankita and Sushant dated for over half-a-decade before breaking up. Sushant died by suicide in 2020, leading to what Ankitaâ€™s mother described as a very difficult period of media attention for the actor.
In an interview with Galatta India, Ankitaâ€™s mother said that the actor has only spoken about Sushant on the show when asked to. Over the years, Ankitaâ€™s mother said, she has only spoken positively about him, and that she maintains good relations with Sushantâ€™s family members. â€œIn addition to Ankita, even Iâ€™ve known Sushant for seven years.

"Director Siva Kumarâ€™s much awaited film Kanguva was once again trending on social media as the makers released the second poster of the film starring Suriya. The Tamil period war film gave a strong insight into the story by showing Suriya in two different avatars. While the first one is that of a warrior, which audience had seen in the first poster as well, the second one is a modern-day man, dressed in a white shirt and beaded necklaces and chains.
The two different looks of the actor in this second poster hints at parallel narratives in the film, although there has been no revelation from the makers. However, the caption of the filmâ€™s production house Studio Greenâ€™s Twitter, sounded mystical. It read, â€œA Destiny Stronger Than Time. The past, present and future. All echo one name! #Kanguva. Here is the #KanguvaSecondLook.â€

"Actor Ankita Lokhandeâ€™s mother, Vandana, spoke about her visit to the Bigg Boss house amid Ankitaâ€™s fractured relationship with husband Vicky Jain on the show. Ankitaâ€™s mother also addressed the comments made by Vickyâ€™s mother about certain things that Ankita has said about him on the show. The couple has been at loggerheads on Bigg Boss, leading to rumours of a separation, but Ankitaâ€™s mother said that the channel is being selective about what it chooses to air.
In an interview with Galatta India, Ankitaâ€™s mother responded to recent comments made by Vickyâ€™s mother, who had brought up Ankitaâ€™s deceased father. Ankita hadnâ€™t appreciated this. Vickyâ€™s mother had taken offence to Ankita seemingly kicking him on the show, and said that her husband expressed his disappointment to Ankitaâ€™s mother that day. â€œWhat was the need to call her? My mother is alone. My father has just passed away. Please donâ€™t involve my parents,â€ sheâ€™d told her mother-in-law on the show.

"Red Chillies VFX has shared a video breakdown of the visual effects work that went into last yearâ€™s biggest Indian film, the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Jawan. Directed by Atlee, the vigilante action film went on to gross over Rs 1100 crore globally, emerging as the most successful film of SRKâ€™s career. Jawan told the story of a vigilante police officer who leads a team of female prisoners in carrying out socially conscious heists. Along the way, he reunites with his father, also played by SRK.
The three-minute VFX breakdown provides insight into several key moments from the film, revealing that the exterior of the metro train in the opening sequence was entirely computer-generated. The prison where a lot of the filmâ€™s action takes place was partially constructed, but enhanced through visual effects. The cottage where Vikram Rathore lived with his wife, played by Deepika Padukone, was created entirely with the help of visual effects. One of the most interesting details revealed in the breakdown video is that the cigar that Vikram smokes in the film was computer-generated, at least in the one shot shown in the video.

"Actors Vijay Sethupathi and Katrina Kaifâ€™s recent release Merry Christmas is holding its ground at the box office, despite facing competition from Telugu and Tamil mass entertainers like Captain Miller and HanuMan in South and their dubbed versions in Hindi. The film on Monday, which marks its fourth day of release entered double digit box office collections and brought the net collection up to Rs 11.38 cr.
According to trade website Sacnilk, Merry Christmas earned Rs 1.65 crore net as per the early estimates. The film has released to a comparatively slow start at the box office, due to its niche genre of being a romantic thriller but word-of-mouth and critical appreciation of Katrina and Vijayâ€™s performance was expected to give the film momentum and attract larger footfall.

"â€œSome classics do date,â€ film director Sriram Raghavan once said. I watched the celebrated filmmakerâ€™s debut feature film Ek Hasina Thi, which is counted among the best thrillers produced by Hindi cinema and I cannot agree with him more. Undoubtedly, the Urmila Matondkar and Saif Ali Khan film is shot well and performed well, but where are the twists and turns that make a mainstream thriller palpable?
Given my experience with the filmmakerâ€™s Badlapur (2015) and Andhadhun (2018), both of which had me on the edge, breathlessly waiting to find out what happens next. So, I jumped up when the chance to watch Ek Hasina Thi came, expecting a lot of chills and a bit of anxiety. Instead, during the 137 minutes of Ek Hasina Thi, there were times I controlled the urge to pick up the remote and forward it a bit, perks that come with the streaming platforms (Yes, go ahead, question me and my generation for our limited attention spans and diminished patience levels).

"Method acting or â€˜getting under the skin of a characterâ€™ is not something you see a lot in Indian cinema. More often than not, all our heroes, especially stars, are pretty much themselves in all their films. Vijay and Leo are identical to Leo and Parthiban. Rajinikanth in Jailer is not all that different from Petta. At best, we get to see different looks of the same person. Rajinikanth was honest when he said at the Ponniyin Selvan 1 audio launch that he just has a set of templates. Thatâ€™s pretty much the â€˜methodâ€™ of all the actors. Interestingly, being himself in all of his films is what makes Vijay Sethupathi original. It is an irony that hereâ€™s an actor who remains himself in all of his films, and we love him for it.
For some reason, Sethupathi doesnâ€™t have to do much. Take the scene in Sriram Raghavanâ€™s Merry Christmas where he is in the neighbourhood gift shop. The owner recognises and asks him if he is Albert. Sethupathi doesnâ€™t do much other than a gentle nod. She then goes, â€œYou have returned from Dubai?â€ Nod. â€œHow is Dubai?â€ He finally opens up, â€œToo many rules.â€ He has actually come from jail. In another instance, he is bewildered by the actions of the other lead character, and all he does is look at her perplexed in the lift. For a Tamil audience, they have seen Sethupathi cut that look so many times, but it is hard to get enough of it. It is lovely to watch Vijay Sethupathi doing Vijay Sethupathi things.

"Well-known Malayalam music director K J Joy died on Monday at his residence in Chennai, film industry sources said. He was 77 years old.
Joy, known as the first â€˜techno musicianâ€™ in the Malayalam film music world for his use of instruments like the keyboard in the 1970s, had been bedridden for some time following a stroke, the sources said.
His funeral will be held in Chennai on Wednesday, they said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan condoled K J Joyâ€™s death saying he attracted a wide range of fans with his innovative music.
â€œMany of his songs gave Malayalees a new musical experience. His death is a great loss to the music world in general and the film industry in particular,â€ the CM said in his condolence message.
Malayalam playback singer-cum-composer M G Sreekumar also condoled his death. â€My heartfelt condolences. May his soul rest in peace,â€ Sreekumar said in his condolence message on Facebook.
K J Joy, born in 1946 at Nellikunnu in Thrissur district of Kerala, composed music for more than two hundred films during his decades-long career in the film industry. He made his debut in Malayalam cinema in 1975 and since then he was the architect of many songs that captivated and enthralled people.
ADVERTISEMENT

"Bollywood actor Raveena Tandon is currently busy promoting her upcoming show Karmma Calling. Raveena, who made her digital debut with Aranyak, was initially the top pick for the lead role in Aarya. Eventually, the role in the Ram Madhvani-directed series went to Sushmita Sen.

She said, â€œWhile these were really exciting scripts, but somewhere I wanted to do something that the audience have never got a chance to see me as before.

"BigHit Music, the management agency of South Korean music septet BTS, on Monday said members RM, Jimin, V and Jung Kook have entered the military for mandatory service and will soon perform their duties at the training camp.
Jin, the oldest BTS member, enlisted in 2022, followed by J-hope last April. Suga, the third member, started his service in September 2023.
Indian Express Entertainment is now on WhatsApp Channels. Follow us for the latest news, interviews, reviews, photos and more.

The remaining four members â€” RM, Jimin, V and Jung Kook â€” initiated the enlistment process in November 2023. In a statement shared on fan community forum Weverse, BigHit Music expressed gratitude towards ARMY, the fan group of the band, for supporting BTS over the years.
â€œThanks to your kind consideration and support this past December, BTS members RM, Jimin, V and Jung Kook have entered the military and will soon be performing their duties at the training camp. Thank you for your interest and support on their enlistment day,â€ the agency said in the statement.
BigHit Music also appealed to fans to refrain from sending gifts to the serving members as it could lead to problems with storage and even misplacement.
â€œThe military barracks are communal spaces shared by military personnel for training together. If a large number of letters and gifts from the fans arrive at the center all at once, it would be difficult to store them and they could be easily lost. Therefore, we kindly ask that fans refrain from sending anything by mail,â€ it said.

Fans can instead send messages for the artists on Weverse, added BigHit Music. The agency also asked for ARMYâ€™s cooperation during the members recruit training graduation ceremony.
â€œIn order to prevent any issues that might occur from crowding, we ask fans to please refrain from visiting the site. Instead, we ask you to keep your heartwarming words of support and farewell in your hearts. We ask for your continued love and support for the BTS members until they complete their service and return. Our company will also strive to provide every support they need during this time.â€
BTS, which debuted in 2013, had announced their hiatus in June 2022. The members hope to reconvene as a unit around 2025 following their service commitment.
In South Korea, all able-bodied men aged 18-28 are required to serve in the military for about two years. All BTS members were allowed to put off starting their military service until they turned 30.

"Tanuja Chandraâ€™s debut film Dushman, a revenge drama, starring Ashutosh Rana as a deadly villain named Gokul Pandit, established his position in Hindi cinema as one of its most talented actors. But he was not the first choice for the role as the filmâ€™s producer, Mahesh Bhatt, with whom he had done the television show Swabhimaan, felt he looked quite innocent. It was only because of Bhattâ€™s Ghulam (1998) that Rana ended up being Gokul Pandit on celluloid.
In an interaction with Lallantop, Rana revealed how he ended up being cast as Gokul Pandit. He shared, â€œGokul Pandit was an unexpected character for me. I had put all my efforts into getting that character. But I was rejected for that role. Mahesh Bhatt told me, â€˜When you smile, you look like a kid.â€™ I used to tell him that I am an actor, you just give me a chance. He loved me a lot but didnâ€™t cast me because he felt I looked innocent. So, he shot Dushman with some model. But Bhatt sahab made me dub for him.â€

"Bollywood actor Sunny Kaushal shares a close bond with his mother Veena Kaushal and maintains a good rapport with his sister-in-law, actor Katrina Kaif. In a recent interview, Sunny opened up about the two significant women in his life, emphasizing that their challenges and experiences cannot be compared.
In a conversation with Bollywood Bubble, Sunny was asked about any similarities he sees in the challenges faced by his mother and Katrina. He responded, â€œI canâ€™t compare mom and Katrina that way because momâ€™s world has always been small. It was limited to me, Vicky (Vicky Kaushal) and dad (Sham Kaushal) and her siblings. She has always found happiness in that. Whereas Katrina, because of the work she does, because in this profession you travel so much, you meet so many peopleâ€¦so comparing them would not be the ideal answer in this situation. They both come from very different worlds and they have seen different worlds. To ask if they have any similarities? I donâ€™t know and thatâ€™s my answer.â€

"Ankita Lokhande and husband Vicky Jainâ€™s tumultuous relationship within the Bigg Boss house have become a focal point in recent headlines. During the latest Weekend Ka Vaar episode, Ankita unveiled shocking revelations from her conversation with her mother-in-law, Ranjana Jain, who made a brief appearance in the house.
In the previous episode, it was disclosed that Vickyâ€™s father had contacted Ankitaâ€™s mother, Vandana Lokhande, following an incident where Ankita threw a slipper at Vicky, questioning if she would show the same behavior towards her late husband. Ankita further delved into the contentious discussion with Vicky.
â€œDo you trust me?â€ she asked Vicky before they started the discussion. â€œMeri mummy ko papa (Vickyâ€™s father) ne phone kiya tha (You father called my mother). (He asked) â€˜Aap aapke pati ko aisi maarti thi kya chappal jute phek ke?â€™ Papa ne aur bhi bola tha. (He said) â€˜Aapki aukat kya hai? (Did you throw chappals at your late husband? He said more. He told my mom, â€˜What is your worth?)â€™ I politely told mummy that she was alone, my papa recently passed away. I genuinely felt guilty and apologised to her. Later, my mom revealed that papa had told her many other things. But I asked her to not bring this up,â€ Ankita told Vicky.

In his response, Vicky defended his fatherâ€™s actions and said, â€œWhat would your father have said? He wouldnâ€™t have liked it. He would have expressed it in some way. Is this different or the same feeling?â€
Vickyâ€™s father did not only said â€œaap apne pati ko bhi aise marti thi kyaâ€ but also â€œaapki aukat kya haiâ€ and many more harsh things to a woman who just lost her husband.
This is cruelty and absurdity. Iâ€™m so irritated with Vickyâ€™s family drama !!#AnkitaLokhande #BiggBoss17 pic.twitter.com/G6VY3MHcV2

He further expressed how his family is being shows as â€˜egoistic rich peopleâ€™ through the show. â€œI feel they are trying to portray Vicky and his family as rich egoistic people and Ankitaâ€™s family is taking all the sufferings. She is still balancing it and taking all the harsh things on herself,â€ he said.

Aapko kya lagta hai? (What is the truth? What do you think is right?)â€
In an attempt to take confirmation from Ankita, Vicky asked her, â€œDoes my family interfere in your career, in our life or what you wear and how you live?â€ Ankita denied but added, â€œOur mothers havenâ€™t seen us like this so it must be affecting them. I have earned a lot of respect and love in your house. I donâ€™t want to lose that because of these fights. That is why I have been apologising. I am ready to say sorry 1000 times.â€
Ankita and Vicky have been married for over two year. The couple dated for a few years before tying the knot in December 2021. Ankita was previously in a relationship with late actor Sushant Singh Rajput.

"(No spoilers. Only murder)
If Katrina Kaif walks up to you and cries about her crisis, you will believe her. She is gifted with a face that is painted with innocence. For when she cries, Katrinaâ€™s eyesâ€“which become amusingly tinier as her cheeks lift and tears start to form- ask for absolute submission. But in Merry Christmas, her sincerity is blended in the whacky mixer grinder of Sriram Raghavan, in whose world you are innocent only when someone else is proven guilty. The thriller cooks up a question: Will you trust what you see, even if Katrina is asking you to?

Shetty, who is set to star as a cop in Rohit Shettyâ€™s maiden OTT series Indian Police Force, said even the audiences are ready to see women actors in action avatars on the screen.

â€œI call her a sheroâ€¦ I would feel odd to do a part thatâ€™s not age-appropriate. Age is just a number. Itâ€™s also about how you are ageing. If you are going to look your age and not look the part, the maker will not cast.
â€œBut if you are not looking that age and you are looking the part, they will. We are already seeing that women are offered some really meaty roles and they are coming into their own. So, itâ€™s a great time for us.â€ Indian Police Force is described as an ode to the selfless service, unconditional commitment and fierce patriotism of police officers across the country.

According to the actor, her role was originally intended for a male actor but the filmmaker decided to cast Shetty instead.
â€œIâ€™m the only female cop in the cop universe that he sets in the series. He has treated the character as a character and not made any changes as per the gender, which is brilliant,â€ she said.

â€œIt was so well-written, and it was tough on paper, and even tougher as an artist to portray. She is a hard nut to crack. She is in a senior position, assertive, and authoritative. So, itâ€™s an amazing part to sink your teeth into,â€ she said. To portray the part, Shetty said she subconsciously sought inspiration from former IPS officer Kiran Bedi.

â€œIâ€™ve played the part exactly the way Rohit wanted it. Maybe you will see an element of her (Bedi). She speaks authoritatively, so this was there at the back of my head,â€ she said.
During the showâ€™s shooting, the actor had broken her leg. As she was recuperating at home, the actor signed her next project â€” the pan-India film KD-The Devil. The period action entertainer, directed by filmmaker Prem, features Druva Sarja and Sanjay Dutt among others.
â€œWhen he (Prem) came to narrate the script, I was like, â€˜Iâ€™ll listen to it but I donâ€™t want to do it because Iâ€™m not in that frame of mindâ€™. He narrated the script and at interval point, with my broken foot, I got up and said, â€˜Iâ€™ll do it.â€™ Shetty also said that she has deliberately chosen to play parts that surprise the audience.

â€œI have decided to do characters that Iâ€™ve not done before and surprise people. Everybody looks at Shilpa Shetty as someone who is glamorous. They forget that Iâ€™ve delivered so many different characters before.
â€œItâ€™s not their fault, as I didnâ€™t do a lot of work in the last ten years. Now, since Iâ€™ve decided to do work, I look at it differently. So, from â€˜Indian Police Forceâ€™ and then KD, it is an absolutely different avatar, my next outing I want it to be totally diverse.â€ Indian Police Force will also feature Shweta Tiwari and Nikitin Dheer.

From Ankita and Vicky meeting their mothers to Munawarâ€™s sister entering the house, emotions are running high for the contestants. The latest promo shows host Karan Johar unhappy with Isha Malviyaâ€™s comments on Munawar Faruqui and Ayesha Khan. This is Karanâ€™s second time hosting Bigg Boss 17 in Salmanâ€™s absence.

"Bobby Deolâ€™s career has always experienced significant highs and lows. However, the challenges peaked in the last decade, leading Deol to take a three-year hiatus, starting in 2014. Despite attempting a comeback in 2017, co-starring with his brother Sunny in Deol Shreyas Talpadeâ€™s Poster Boys, the film proved to be a box-office failure, further impacting Deolâ€™s career. Nonetheless, he found relief in 2018 when Remo Dâ€™Souzaâ€™s Race 3 became a hit, despite receiving poor reviews.
Since then, he has been on a trial-and-error process, encountering both successes and setbacks in his projects. After a long time, Bobby Deolâ€™s career witnessed a massive hit in 2023 with Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Animal, where he played the antagonist. Earning over Rs 900 crore Animal emerged as the third-highest-grossing Indian film of 2023.

In an interview with Bollywood Bubble, Sunny shared that he and Vicky grew up watching their parents and their relationship with their siblings. He said, â€œWe are very protective of each other and nobody taught us that, we just knew that. When we were in a group, and it was just boys, and we were playing, say cricket or football or something, we knew that we had to stick with each other. That comes very naturally.

Starring Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Raveena Tandon, and Karishma Kapoor in lead roles, the film was a flop at the box office at the time of its release.

"The premise of Lift, which is the latest movie to be added to Netflixâ€™s catalogue of heist thrillers, sounds fascinating as a massive consignment of gold is to be stolen mid-air. The thriller shot in some of the most beautiful locations of the world, including Venice, Switzerland and Ireland, looks slick. The movie, which presumably wants to be an edge-of-the-seat thriller, is powered by a diverse cast. Yet, the movie helm by F. Gary Gray, who has directed movies like The Italian Job (2003) and The Fate of the Furious (2017), falls short of being gripping as it goes for style over substance.
Written by Daniel Kunka, Lift follows the adventures of a professional thief Cyrus Whitaker (Kevin Hart) and his expert crew as they attempt the ultimate heist: stealing USD 500 million in gold from a vault on a plane â€” 40000 feet in the air as it flies over the Alps. The thriller has a team of hackers who can make the most complicated heists look like childâ€™s play. Thatâ€™s established with a lengthy opening sequence when an enigmatic artist is whisked away by the gang and an intense chase on Venice canals ensues. Soon after, Interpol agent Abby Gladwell (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), who is hot on Whitakerâ€™s trail, approaches him with the proposal to steal the gold at her senior officialâ€™s behest.

"Venkatesh Daggubatiâ€™s 75th film, in a career spanning 37 years, is a landmark film. Having revived his career with Drushyam films, F2 and most recently maiden OTT venture Rana Naidu, Venkatesh is not ready to slow down. The mostly negative criticism for Rana Naidu appears to have rattled him, as he has been a mascot for family entertainment almost all of his career. Perhaps that is the reason he has chosen a family-centric action thriller as his 75th project. After successfully delivering two HIT series thrillers, this is a huge next step for director Sailesh Kolanu as well, with Rs 80 crore as its massive budget.
Saindhav is set in a fictional city called Chandra Prastha, which is a hotbed for terrorism, smuggling and also supplies mercenaries to the world. Most of the activity is controlled by a cartel, headed by Vishwamitra (Mukhesh Rishi), supported by Vikas Malik (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) and Michael (Jishu Sen Gupta).

"â€œIf at first you donâ€™t succeed, try, try again â€” and you might end up like Indian film actor Amrish Puri,â€ read the text along with the Google Doodle on June 22, 2019, to commemorate the 87th birth anniversary of one of Indian cinemaâ€™s most memorable villain. Such was the journey of the man who was best at being the worst on-screen.
One can argue that you need a great villain to make a great hero, Amrish Puri assumed that space. And how. The seasoned actor, with his baritone, big eyes, and twitched forehead, struck terror in the hearts of heroes, heroines and fans alike. Whether it was as Mogambo, Durjan Singh or Baba Bhairo Nath, this student of theatre doyens, Ebrahim Alkazi and Satyadev Dubey, made baddies in Bollywood memorable. He created his own brand of villainy. While pages can be filled in appreciation of Puriâ€™s vast canvas as a villain, thatâ€™s not all there is to him.

"Every movie in the world, including those that havenâ€™t yet been made, could benefit greatly from a spot of Bill Nighy. And never before has this theory been proven so unambiguously than in the new Prime Video movie Role Play. An instantly forgettable action-comedy in which Kaley Cuoco plays a secret assassin living a double life as a regular person with a loving husband and two kids, Role Play is a mostly lifeless experience that is practically resuscitated by Nighy in a 15-minute cameo.
He has the unique ability to command your attention even if he isnâ€™t doing anything. If he were to be cast as a lamppost, you could count on him to make it the most evocative lamppost performance of all time. This isnâ€™t hyperbole; while Nighy has thankfully never played an inanimate object in his career, he once voiced a villainous Pokemon. He was just as committed to that role as he was to his Oscar-nominated performance in Living. And as with most projects fortunate enough to have him on board, Nighy is the best thing about Role Play as well.

"â€œFor small creatures such as we, the vastness is bearable only through love,â€ reads a popular quote from Carl Saganâ€™s novel Contact, an inspiration for countless sci-fi films and stories. In essence, it contextualizes humans from the perspective of an extraterrestrial life form. A notable exploration of such an idea in India is Aamir Khanâ€™s PK. While the Bollywood film delved into the belief systems and values of humans, Ayalaan superficially touches on such â€˜deepâ€™ subjects. Upon arrival, the alien in this film finds a plastic bag, and its advanced system reveals that plastic takes 300 years to decay. Later, a drunkard mistakes it for a fellow alcoholic and gives him some money. The system now says that it is just paper and will decay relatively fast. The alien discards both items with equal disdain. It also has a similar distaste for all the junk food consumed by humans. Naturally, when he is desperate for some help on Earth, he â€˜gravitatesâ€™ (since itâ€™s an alien film) towards the hero Tamizh. Now, Tamizh is an organic farmer who would rather live in poverty than use pesticides. He politely pleads with the locust swarm (because even that is a life form too) to leave as it destroys his cornfield in minutes. You get the drift.
The reason the alienâ€”by the way, he is called Tattoo by his human friends for a reason thatâ€™s not as funny as it is supposed to beâ€”arrives on Earth is to inspect a catastrophe caused by new technology. It finds out the man behind the menace, Aryan. These days, Tamil filmmakers arenâ€™t too subtle about the nomenclature and the politics behind it. If the hero is named Tamizh, it is fitting that the villain is Aryan (Sharad Kelkar). But no brownie points for the way his character is written. He is the quintessential Jagapathi Babu kind of villain who has gotten hold of an alien rock called Spark, which gives immense power for deep mining. He drills too deep into the Earth, and the prehistoric toxins are released into the atmosphere, which, obviously, is not good news. The rest is as predictable as it can get, except for the bond Tamizh and Tattoo form. It goes beyond being just emotional bromance as they start sharing powers. It is only fair that the villain gets some of it, and so he does. It is all achieved with some contrived writing.

"Oscar-winning British actor Anthony Hopkins steps into the role of psychologist Sigmund Freud in a new film that features a fictional debate with author C.S. Lewis.

"Bollywood fans got excited when a video featuring Ranbir Kapoor and Konkona Sen Sharma went viral a few days ago, sparking discussions about Wake Up Sid 2. However, their hopes were crushed when it was revealed that the video was just an ad, not a teaser for the anticipated sequel. Ranbir and Konkona have reunited after almost 15 years and the latest advertisement brought back some core Wake Up Sid memories.
In the ad, Sid moves to Goa with Ayesha, just like in the original film where he introduced her to Mumbai. As they settle into their new home, Sid feels a bit unsure about them shifting to Goa, but the love of friends, his wife Ayesha, and a thoughtful gift from his father, the Oppo Reno 11 Pro, help him feel at ease. Towards the end of the ad, Konkona made a bread and jam cake for Ranbir, just how Sid made for Aisha in the film. The title â€˜Sid wakes up in Goaâ€™ features at the beginning of the ad.

"The 75th Emmy Awards will be studded with cast reunions and recreations of classic moments from a dozen beloved shows throughout television history.
All in the Family, Greyâ€™s Anatomy, Game of Thrones, Martin and many more series will get the special treatment at Monday nightâ€™s ceremony at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles, with many getting renditions of their sets, including the bar from Cheers.
Indian Express Entertainment is now on WhatsApp Channels. Follow us for the latest news, interviews, reviews, photos and more.

â€œIt was really about, how can we celebrate 75 years of television differently?â€ the showâ€™s executive producer Jesse Collins told The Associated Press.
The first such scene will come within the 10 minutes of host Anthony Andersonâ€™s Emmys opening, and the moments will be spread throughout the Fox telecast.
â€œThe core of it,â€ said Dionne Harmon, another executive producer, â€œis really celebrating television and to honor the shows of yesterday while we honor the shows of today.â€
Collins, Harmon and Jeannae Rouzan-Clay from Jesse Collins Entertainment are producing the Emmys for the first time, after previously putting on the Oscars, American Music Awards and BET Awards.
ADVERTISEMENT
With the tribute segments theyâ€™re seeking to show decades of television in its full variety of styles, formats and periods.
From the Emmysâ€™ earliest days in the 1950s will come I Love Lucy; from the 1960s, The Carol Burnett Show, whose title star recently won her seventh Emmy at age 90; from the 1970s, All in the Family, whose legendary creator, TV legend Norman Lear, died last month at 101.
  Cheers will represent the â€™80s. Ally McBeal and Martin will represent different sides of the â€™90s. The television-game-changing Sopranos will show up from the early 2000s.
Shows still on the air â€” Greyâ€™s Anatomy and American Horror Story â€” will also be represented.
ADVERTISEMENT
Bits featuring Saturday Night Live and The Arsenio Hall Show will show up for variety and talk.
â€œWe just tried to pick ones that we felt like we could successfully pay tribute to,â€ Collins said. â€œWe have a pretty vast array of comedies and procedural dramas and talk shows, just trying to touch all the different areas.â€
And the shows come from all four networks and HBO, a perennial Emmys juggernaut that this year has all three of the top nominated shows â€” â€œSuccession,â€ â€œThe Last of Usâ€ and â€œThe White Lotus,â€ â€” and was home to the winningest drama of all time, which is also among the classic shows getting honored.
â€œWe have a great â€˜Game of Thronesâ€™ moment,â€ Collins said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Producers didnâ€™t give specifics on who will be appearing, and said not to expect everyone from every show.
Reunions arenâ€™t possible for all of them, of course. â€œI Love Lucy,â€ whose key cast members have all been dead for decades, will get a recreation by actors playing Lucy and Ethel.
Other shows have few left to reunite. All in the Family only has two surviving major cast members, Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers. The same is true of The Carol Burnett Show, with only Burnett and Vicki Lawrence still alive.
They also said not to expect a reunion of the cast of Friends, though the show will include some tribute to Matthew Perry, who died in October.
ADVERTISEMENT
Emmy producers said they tried to take a different approach to each of the segments to make sure it doesnâ€™t start to feel like a repetitive trope.
â€œWe want to make sure people remain entertained and engaged so you never really know what youâ€™re going to see, even with the reunions,â€ Rouzan-Clay told the AP.
While wrangling multiple actors from different eras is never easy, and synching schedules was a tangled thicket as everyone became available again with the end of the writers and actors strikes that pushed the show from September to January, Emmy organizers didnâ€™t have to twist many arms to get people to take part.
â€œPeople are happy to be back and happy to celebrate,â€ Harmon said. â€œIt is a monumental year. Everybody was really excited to come be a part of this.â€"
"A group of South Korean filmmakers, actors and industry officials, including Parasite director Bong Joon-ho, on Friday called for a probe into the handling by police and media of drug abuse allegations involving late actor Lee Sun-kyun.
Lee, who shot to global fame with his performance as the wealthy patriarch in the Oscar-winning film Parasite, was found dead last month in an apparent suicide.
Bong and more than a dozen other film, music and entertainment industry figures held a news conference in Seoul, urging authorities to look into whether police handled Leeâ€™s case without violating security and privacy rules.
ADVERTISEMENT
Since his case was first reported by a local newspaper citing a police official, Lee suffered attacks on his reputation due to constant leaks about the investigation even after multiple drug tests came back negative, they said.
Also Read | Lee Sun-kyun death: Parasite actor underwent 19-hour interrogation in drugs case, had asked for a lie detector test to prove innocence
They also denounced â€œsensationalâ€ coverage by some news outlets and YouTubers focusing on Leeâ€™s private life using unverified information, calling it â€œyellow journalism.â€
â€œWe call for a fact-finding probe into whether there were any security problems regarding the police investigation,â€ Bong said, reading a statement signed by more than 2,000 artists and 29 industry associations.

â€œWeâ€™re asking the press and media,â€ singer-songwriter Yoon Jong-shin said, â€œWasnâ€™t your coverage sensational, highlighting someoneâ€™s private life just because he was a pop culture artist?â€
Calls to Incheon police, which investigated Lee went unanswered. Its chief has denied violating security rules while expressing regret over his death.
Leeâ€™s death rekindled criticism from the entertainment industry and the public over the often harsh and public nature of any criminal investigations involving celebrities which fuelled media coverage and pressure on them.
Yoon singled out a report by public broadcaster KBS using a recording of Leeâ€™s phone call with a bar hostess, questioning if it was meant to serve peopleâ€™s right to know and demanding it be deleted.
ADVERTISEMENT
KBS said in a statement it stood by its reporting that was aired more than a month before Leeâ€™s death and the content was used with â€œmaximum restraintâ€ to uncover the facts of the case.
â€œThe recording was used in a very limited way because it was not irrelevant to the allegations (against Lee) but was in fact supporting the credibility of the claim,â€ it said.
Lee made three highly public appearances before police between October and December, the last time for 19 hours overnight.
He had denied knowingly taking illegal drugs and said he was tricked by the bar hostess who later blackmailed him, local news media reported before his death.
ADVERTISEMENT
Lee was the latest in a long line of South Korean artists and celebrities to took their lives, already under intense pressure from competition and prying interest in their personal lives, often aggravated by online bullying and personal attacks.
South Korea has the highest suicide rate among developed countries."

"It has become hard to write about Tamil cinema without mentioning Quentin Tarantino. His influence is now omnipresent. While most try only to emulate his â€˜coolâ€™ aesthetics, where even violence becomes fun, Arun Matheswaran digs deeper. It is not just the style; Arun Matheswaran recreates the catharsis that one gets from watching Django Unchained.
It wouldnâ€™t be a stretch to call Captain Miller an Indian Django Unchained. The parallels are obvious. If Django Unchained is the journey of an empowered slave with a bounty hunter, Captain Miller is the story of a caste-oppressed villager. Instead of Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), we have Kannaiya (Elango Kumaravel). For one Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), we have many stand-ins like Kumastha Kanagasabai (Kali Venkat) and sepoy James (Ashwin Kumar). Of course, the politics of black slavery and Indian casteism are two different oppression machines, and thatâ€™s where Arun Mateswaranâ€™s brilliance lies. He brings in so many layers to this political drama, which masquerades as an action-driven star vehicle.

"Veteran actor Boman Irani, who was recently seen in Shah Rukh Khan starrer Dunki, has opened up about his experience working with SRK in several films. Boman explained how Shah Rukh eases the tension on sets by cracking a joke on himself and added that people always look forward to his arrival. 
In an interview with Connect FM Canada, Boman said, â€œI think Shah Rukh Khan understands where he came from. I think Iâ€™m judging. I may be wrong, but he understands what it is for a person to be doing one of their first films in the film industry and how one is treated. Not as a commodity, not as a person whoâ€™s supplying something; that person is supplying his talent, his art, his being. I think he understands that.â€

"Actor Saurabh Sachdeva, who appeared in a supporting role in the blockbuster film Animal, spoke about director Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s clutter-breaking approach to filmmaking and the divisive reactions that the film has drawn. Starring Ranbir Kapoor, Animal has grossed over Rs 900 crore worldwide, and has emerged as the third-biggest Indian film of 2023. But it also attracted criticism for scenes perceived to be belittling towards women.
In an interview, Saurabh said that he doesnâ€™t quite agree with the defence that Ranbir is playing an â€˜alpha maleâ€™, and admitted that he hasnâ€™t made up his mind about where he stands on the filmâ€™s morality. Saurabh, who also operates an acting school, said that he has had several discussions about the film with his students, and finds himself agreeing with both sides of the argument. He did, however, say that any movie that is able to elicit strong reactions from the audience is more admirable than something that doesnâ€™t register at all.

"Trivikram Srinivasâ€™ Guntur Kaaram serves as definitive proof that in-form Mahesh Babu can keep us hooked to a 159-minute movie without feeling fatigued. Ok, that sounds misleading; letâ€™s rephraseâ€¦ Mahesh Babu, in top-notch form, is the sole redeeming factor in Trivikramâ€™s unnecessarily stretched Guntur Kaaram, preventing it from becoming a tedious watch. Yep, that sounds more accurate.
The biggest and most anticipated film of this Sankranti/Pongal season, Guntur Kaaram is basically a celebration of Tollywoodâ€™s superstar and everything associated with his stardom. Trivikram keeps Mahesh Babu front and centre, never giving the audience a chance to miss him.

"Actor Ankita Lokhande, who is a contestant on Bigg Boss 17, has often talked about her former boyfriend Sushant Singh Rajput, who passed away in 2020, to her co-contestants Munawar Faruqui and Abhishek Kumar. Many viewers consider it her way of seeking sympathy from the audience. Even her husband Vicky Jainâ€™s mother said that Ankita has been repeatedly taking Sushantâ€™s name for â€œsympathyâ€. After listening to all the chatter around her daughter, Ankitaâ€™s mother Vandana Lokhande, who entered the Bigg Boss house on Thursday, explained to her why she should not talk about the past.
On Thursdayâ€™s episode of Bigg Boss 17, Vandana met her daughter Ankita and son-in-law Vicky and told them how their fights inside the house are becoming a matter of gossip outside. She also told them to be careful about the words they use for each other. After talking to both of them, she sat down with Ankita in the garden area and told her to focus on her present, not past, hinting at her conversations about Sushant.

"Actor Shah Rukh Khan broke his silence on the many successes and setbacks that he has experienced in the last few years, as he accepted an honour at a recent awards ceremony. In his speech, Shah Rukh alluded to the arrest of his son, Aryan Khan, and spoke about the trio of hit film that he starred in last year. He also charmed the crowd with his trademark wit and fun interactions with others, such as director Mani Ratnam. But a kind gesture that he made towards P Veeramuthuvel, the project director in charge of the Chandrayaan-3 mission, caught the attention of his fans on social media, and a video of the moment is being widely shared online.
The short clip from the end of the awards ceremony shows Shah Rukh pulling Veeramuthuvel towards him, making sure that the ISRO scientist gets his moment in the spotlight. The shy Veeramuthuvel was trying to remain in the background, but Shah Rukh wouldnâ€™t have it. Previously, the actor had obliged the ISRO team by joining them on stage for a photograph. Veeramuthuvel was joined on stage by ISRO chairman S Somanath, and they were felicitated by union minister Dr Jitendra Singh, who described the chairman as â€˜the Shah Rukh Khan of spaceâ€™, much to the actorâ€™s amusement.

Katrinaâ€™s husband and actor Vicky Kaushal watched it at the filmâ€™s premiere in Mumbai and is completely in awe of it. He took to social media to share his review of the movie and gave a shoutout to his wife Katrina for her performance.

"The Sankranthi movie releases this year touched a new high with four Telugu films coming out simultaneously. While Ravi Tejaâ€™s Eagle bowed out from the race at the last minute, Teja Sajjaâ€™s HanuMan has multiple biggies to compete with as it releases today. Despite the big names in the fray, HanuMan â€” with relative newcomers such as Prashanth Varma and Teja Sajja in the driving seat â€” stuck to its guns, and upped the stakes with paid premiers and a bold marketing strategy. The current mood of the nation with the Ayodhya Temple ceremony also played an important part.
HanuMan takes the major elements from the Ramayana and squeezes it into an egg-sized gem, calling it Rudhira Mani (blood gem) and places it in Anjanadri village. In the first half, we see Hanuman as a silent witness to all the happenings in that village. We meet the filmâ€™s bad guy, Gajapathi (Raj Deepak Shetty), a big man in the small village, and its hero, Hanumanthu (Teja Sajja), a petty thief.

"Actor Pankaj Tripathi has been playing all his roles with utmost perfection, be it that of a criminal in Mirzapur and Gangs of Wasseypur or that of an emotional father in Bareilly Ki Barfi and Gunjan Saxena. All his roles, to this day, have been based in the heartland of the country and the audience has barely seen him as a royal or a rich character. But this is not by choice. Tripathi believes he is equally capable of acing a â€œposhâ€ role if given an opportunity. However, he mentioned in a recent interview that in cinema, people tend to stereotype and box actors into particular roles based on their looks.
While interacting with ANI, Tripathi insisted on â€˜changing the perspective of cinemaâ€™. He said, â€œIn cinema, we have made a stereotype that a doctor looks like this, an engineer looks like that. During auditions, a brief is written even for the junior artists like â€˜rich look, corporate lookâ€™. Humne baant rakha hai duniya ko, ki ye look hota hai, vo look hota hai (We have divided the world based on looks). We imagine Katrina Kaif in the role of a doctor. But you go to Delhiâ€™s AIIMS, how many Katrinas will you find there?â€

"The lucrative Sankranti weekend is all set to host a clash between several Telugu films, most notably the Mahesh Babu-starrer Guntur Kaaram and the mythological superhero film HanuMan. Directed by Trivikram Srinivas, Guntur Kaaram is an old-school â€˜masalaâ€™ potboiler that also features Sreeleela. The movie is set to pick up where the Prabhas-starrer Salaar left off, marking an auspicious start to the new year for the Telugu box office. Three other films â€“ HanuMan, Saindhav and Naa Saami Ranga â€“ are also vying for attention this weekend.
According to the industry tracker Sacnilk, Guntur Kaaram has sold advance tickets worth nearly Rs 25 crore for day one, just in India. HanuMan, on the other hand, has sold advance tickets worth Rs 3 crore so far. Late last year, Salaar defied expectations to deliver an opening day domestic haul of Rs 90 crore, and has since made Rs 400 crore in India and more than Rs 700 crore globally.

"Celebrity trainer Kris Gethin, who has worked with Bollywood stars such as Hrithik Roshan and Vicky Kaushal closely, opened up about their different approach to work. He said that Vicky is â€˜too niceâ€™ to turn down unreasonable work-related requests and can survive on very little sleep, but Hrithik would never compromise on recovery because heâ€™s built differently. In an interview, Gethin spoke about his longtime association with Hrithik, and said that he only works with the people whom he can vibe with on a human level.
Asked if he has noticed any striking differences between the actors that he works with, Gethin told India Today, â€œLetâ€™s talk about Vicky and Hrithik. With Vicky, he doesnâ€™t sleep much, because his hours are just so, so long. I had this issue with John Abraham as well, where these people are too nice. Vicky is one of the nicest people Iâ€™ve ever met, and I donâ€™t think he likes to say no to too many people, so if the directors want him shooting till silly oâ€™clock, he does that. Sometimes, heâ€™ll be running on four hours sleep. But you would never know. He doesnâ€™t come across tired, he doesnâ€™t moan, he doesnâ€™t whinge, and on the set heâ€™s so energetic. But that wouldnâ€™t happen with Hrithik.â€

"A time that was, in a city that was Bombay. A balmy Christmas Eve. Two lonely strangers. Sriram Raghavanâ€™s Merry Christmas delivers what it promises â€” an aching mix of nostalgia and romance, intrigue and suspense â€” in a solid start to the new year.
There are very few filmmakers who can create a slice of the past in such a deeply affectionate, authentic manner, and Raghavan is one of those.Because he is such a film aficionado, we expect and get all kinds of shout-outs, to the 1962 French film â€˜Le Monte-chargeâ€™ â€˜Merry Christmasâ€™ is based on, the pulsating song â€˜jab andhera hota haiâ€™ from the 1973 Bollywood potboiler â€˜Raja Raniâ€™, the covers of such evergreen LPs as â€˜McKennaâ€™s Goldâ€™, and that master of noir thrillers, Raymond Chandler. Itâ€™s all a vintage wine vibe, fiery and silky."
"Shah Rukh Khan, Taapsee Pannu and Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s Dunki is receiving unwavering love and support from Indians all over the world at the box office.

According to the filmâ€™s production house, Red Chillies Entertainment, the worldwide box office collection of Dunki stands at Rs 452.87 crore.
However, the Shah Rukh Khan starrer has hit a plateau when it comes to its domestic box office earnings. The film that has been doing reasonably well in theatres earned Rs 1.15 crore (nett) on Thursday (day 22 of its release), and it yet to cross the Rs 250 crore milestone in India.

"Celebrity fitness trainer Kris Gethin, who has worked with Hrithik Roshan for over a decade, spoke about the hard work that goes into cultivating the sort of physique that inspires admiration and envy among the masses. In an interview, he said that Hrithik has certain genetic gifts, but it is primarily his discipline and dedication that gets him looking like he does. Hrithik is often described as a â€˜Greek godâ€™, and recently underwent a new round of intense training to prepare for his starring role in the film Fighter.
In an interview with India Today, Gethin spoke about Hrithikâ€™s training schedule for Fighter, and said that the actor wakes up at 5 am, and itâ€™s lights out by 9 pm. â€œI like to work with people who are genuinely nice and authentic, and heâ€™s definitely one of those people. Heâ€™s very intuitive, very high IQ. He knows what works for him, what doesnâ€™t work for him. For Fighter, his day would usually start at 5 or 6 amâ€¦ By 6 heâ€™s eating his breakfast, and then weâ€™re hitting the gym probably 45 minutes after that.â€

"The Prabhas-starrer Salaar will make way for a slew of Sankranti releases this weekend, having finally passed the Rs 400 crore mark in India. The film has little else to accomplish now, as it prepares to conclude its theatrical run and begin a new life on streaming. On its 21st day of release, Salaar made Rs 1.75 crore in India, according to industry tracker Sacnilk. This puts the filmâ€™s total domestic collections at Rs 401 crore.
Salaar marks Prabhasâ€™ first hit since 2017â€™s Baahubali 2: The Conclusion. The actor had starred in a string of back-to-back big-budget bombs in the past few years, raising concerns about his bankability. This time around, he was aided by KGF director Prashanth Neel, who is coming off the biggest Indian hit of 2022, KGF: Chapter 2. Salaar is designed as the start of a new franchise, with a second installment already having been announced.

"No one in filmmaker Joe Babyâ€™s Kaathal- The Core gets angry. They are lonely, ashamed, trapped and even annoyed. But never angry, an emotion that has otherwise dominated blockbusters of last year. In Mammoottyâ€™s latest Malayalam drama, people look out for people, and family comes together, even as the patriarch struggles to come out.
The enormously moving filmâ€“currently streaming on Prime Videoâ€“is a gentle call for sensitivity as it tries to understand the complexities of coming out. It is optimistic that relationships can be redeemed, even as it follows a marriage falling apart; it remains hopeful that one can continue to love, even if they nurse a broken heart. Featuring possibly one of the most effective performances of last year, Mammootty crafts Mathew Devassy as a man who must rescue himself from the trap that his loved ones and community set him up in. How do you break free, without breaking apart?

"Whatâ€™s worse, chaining your movie to a plot so dated that it involves NFTs, or having a character explain what an NFT is? Ultimately, the new Netflix movie Lift does both. Starring Kevin Hart and a host of others whom youâ€™d recognise as â€˜that guy from that thingâ€™, Lift plays like a particularly cynical concoction of a late-period Fast & Furious film and a mid-2000s heist movie set in Europe.
Itâ€™s no wonder, then, that it is helmed by F Gary Gray, a Hollywood journeyman who has directed one of each in the past. But while The Italian Job was a mostly enjoyable romp, his The Fate of the Furious was an overblown mess marred by infighting among the filmâ€™s two lead stars. Gray also couldnâ€™t catch a break with his last film, the failed franchise-starter Men in Black: International. Making the movie was reportedly such a traumatic experience for him, he attempted to bail on the project on several occasions. Itâ€™s anybodyâ€™s guess if he had a better time on Lift, because audiences probably wonâ€™t."
"Tamil film Annapoorani: The Goddess of Food has been removed from Netflix amid complaints that it hurt religious sentiments. The streamer said in a statement that the decision was made per â€˜the licensorâ€™s requestâ€™.
Ever since it started streaming on Netflix on December 29, the film has faced protests and police complaints, with claims that it contained â€œcontroversialâ€ remarks about Lord Ram and â€œpromoted love jihadâ€.

"Pankaj Tripathi says many people come up to him for selfies and sometimes they have not even seen any of his work but they know about his performance through memes and reels that keep trending on social media.
The actor, whose Kaleen Bhaiyaâ€™s character from the Prime Video series Mirzapur first became a viral meme, credits the public for making him into a popular face.
â€œI just say what I feel like. Iâ€™m glad people connect to it. Janta (public) has made me popular with memes and reels. Iâ€™m the hero of the audience, they made me a popular actor. I donâ€™t know marketing and all. Earlier, I would turn up for interviews and events dressed casually, but now I dress up,â€ Tripathi told PTI.

Tripathi, who hails from Belsand village in Gopalganj district of Bihar, narrated an incident from his birthplace to reiterate his social media popularity and how it sometimes has nothing to do with his movies.
â€œRecently, I came across two boys in my village. They came to me and said they wanted a picture with me. I was like, â€˜Which film or show of mine have you seen?â€™ They said, â€˜We havenâ€™t seen any of them but we have seen your memesâ€™. They were like, â€˜We are just happy to see youâ€™,â€ he recalled.
The actor, who will next be seen in a biopic on former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, understands commercial cinemaâ€™s ability to reach a wide audience. His own taste in cinema may veer towards the middle-of-the-road and independent projects but he always tries to strike a balance when it comes to his roles, he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Tripathi said he is an admirer of films such as Court, Killa, Trance and Mandela but commercial cinema, with its power to reach more people, can also impart a message.
â€œMy sense of cinema is that it should be sensible yet commercial, and have a wide reach. We make films with the intention to reach out to more people. Like, â€˜Oh My God 2â€™ is sensible cinema. It was such a solid subject about sex education and it did well at the box office and on OTT,â€ Tripathi said.
â€œWe often learn a lot of things when said in a light-hearted manner. While, the moment we become serious, we might lose interest. But as an audience my interest is in independent cinema,â€ he added.
Tripathi said his upcoming release, Main Atal Hoon, on former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, is made in a sensible and engaging manner.
ADVERTISEMENT
The biographical drama is directed by filmmaker Ravi Jadhav of Natarang and Balgandharva fame.
â€œThis is the story of Atal jiâ€™s life and also of Indiaâ€™s journey from the time of independence, how elections would happen, how voting would happen, how society changed. The purpose of the biopic is to provide entertainment and at the same time it serves as an inspiration,â€ the actor said.
The actor further said when he first arrived on the Main Atal Hoon set, he didnâ€™t feel â€œconfidentâ€.
â€œIâ€™m never confident on the first day of shoot irrespective of the role, whether it is fictional or non-fictional. Iâ€™m always like, â€˜What will I do? How will I do it? For two-three days, Iâ€™ve been struggling to find the sur of the character.

On the first day of the shoot of â€˜Main Atal Hoonâ€™, I was doing all the loud gestures and postures. I was sure I didnâ€™t want to imitate Atal ji or get close to him in terms of his look with the help of prosthetics, I had to capture his soul.â€ In response to a question about how the team ensured the movie would not end up as propaganda, Tripathi said they had made every effort to be authentic.
â€œWe were aware and conscious about it but our whole purpose was to bring out the persona of Atal ji on the big screen. Since the film is a biopic, we had to make sure that we got things factually correct,â€ he said.
â€œI feel one should present the person on screen in the most honest possible way. We are humans, we have both goodness and shortcomings and thatâ€™s how it should be presented on screen,â€ he added.

Produced by Vinod Bhanushali, Sandeep Singh, and Kamlesh Bhanushali, Main Atal Hoon will hit theatres on January 19. Bhavesh Bhanushali and Sam Khan serve as co-producers on the movie.

The duo officially announced their upcoming film, Thug Life, on Ratnamâ€™s birthday in November 2023.

On Wednesday, the viewers saw Ayesha Khan breaking down after revealing details of her relationship with Munawar Faruqui. Ayesha accused Munawar of allegedly cheating on her as she said, â€œWhat was my fault in all this? I never wronged him or anyone. If he was in a relationship with Nazila Sitaishi (his former girlfriend) and wanted to continue things with her, then he shouldnâ€™t have approached me. Iâ€™m unable to understand anything. This breaks my heart. I was quiet only because of him but not anymore.â€

"Twinkle Khanna frequently shares glimpses of her life on Instagram, and in her recent post, she opened up about her close bond with sister Rinke Khanna, talking about their teasing dynamic and mutual support. The post included a picture from their holiday, as well as a throwback photo featuring the Khanna sisters with their father, Rajesh Khanna.
In the caption, Twinkle humorously reflected on their contrasting statures, likening their relationship to Tom and Jerry or Laurel and Hardy. She wrote, â€œMy sister and I are a year apart. I was always the giant, and she was petite. At times, we resembled Tom and Jerry, and sometimes, depending on my weight, Laurel and Hardy. Of course, we teased each other mercilessly. As her husband likes to recount, when he first came to meet my sister, I informed him, â€˜You need to know we have different fathers. My father is Vinod Khanna, and hers is Rajesh Khanna, thatâ€™s why I am tall and she is not.â€™ My sister was livid, though I thought it was quite funny. But whenever I am in trouble, she is the first one by my side. She calls me every day, even if itâ€™s to chat about mundane events. I canâ€™t say that if life is a desert, she is my only oasis, but I know that under the scorching sun, she will definitely share that wide-brimmed hat with me, even if itâ€™s just to throw some shade my way:) Hereâ€™s to sisters and what would we do without them. What is the funniest thing your sister has done to you? Let me know in the comments below.â€

In the 2010 film â€˜My Name is Khanâ€™ by Karan Johar, Gourav, who was only 14 years old at the time, played the character of a young Shah Rukh Khan.

On Humans of Bombay, Gourav said that was really excited about meeting SRK and going to America when he got the call for the film. Unfortunately, neither of these happened, and he ended up shooting in Mumbai without meeting SRK. He said, â€œI was very excited to meet Shah Rukh Khan, and I never met him until a month ago after being in the same film because I was playing his younger version, so there was no overlap.â€

"Taapsee Pannu is currently savouring the success of her latest film Dunki, which saw her starring alongside Shah Rukh Khan. In a recent interview, the actor spoke about how she wants to break the perception that she doesnâ€™t do hero-centric films and only stars in projects that have her as the main character. Taapsee also revealed that she couldnâ€™t believe she is starring in Dunki even after she signed the film.
Speaking about the perception about her in the Hindi film industry, Taapsee told Bollywood Hungama, â€œThere is this big misconception that I am tired of clearing. It is often said that I donâ€™t do films if my character isnâ€™t at the centre stage in a film. From Javed Akhtar to everybody had told me, â€˜You donâ€™t do films in which you arenâ€™t the main lead, you wonâ€™t do a film if it revolves around a hero.â€™ I was like who is spreading this!â€
She added, â€œI think this can also be the reason that many big films donâ€™t even come to me because it is assumed that I wonâ€™t do them. It is also because sometimes anyone can do those characters. There isnâ€™t a specific requirement from the actor. For those kind of films there are so many options that filmmakers donâ€™t even reach me, and I also not part of that group where my name would instantly be taken. Everybody has their comfort zone and people will approach those who are in the zone.â€
Also read | Taapsee Pannu says she was star-struck by Shah Rukh Khan, recalls he rehearses every scene 50 times: â€˜I would just zone out mid takeâ€™
Talking about how she was in disbelief even after signing Dunki, Taapsee said, â€œEverybody isnâ€™t like Rajkumar Hirani sir. He doesnâ€™t necessarily need that comfort zone. He texted me out of the blue after watching Manmarziyaan. After watching a lot of my films, purely on merit, he reached out to me for Dunki. It was too good to be true and which is why I didnâ€™t believe it till the first schedule of the film got over. People would ask me at home, â€˜Tu picture mein hai na? Nikal toh nahi dia tujh? (You are in the film right? They didnâ€™t kick you out?). In fact, one-and-a-half years before the film went on floors, people were telling me that Raju sir might be looking at some other actors, nothing came from Raju sir though, he was sure about me. So, it was difficult for me to settle down and accept that I am doing this film.â€

"(Warning: This review contains spoilers) Our predecessors, the legends, used to say that comedy is the most challenging, both in writing and performing. True; itâ€™s significantly harder to make someone laugh than to make them cry. However, in todayâ€™s era, it seems that pulling off the thriller genre is the most formidable task. The widespread exposure to films, shows, true crime podcasts and other content from around the world has enabled audiences to easily see through things and discern plot twists, thus making it challenging for filmmakers to captivate them with thrillers now.
Midhun Manuel Thomasâ€™ Abraham Ozler, starring Jayaram in the titular role, can be dubbed as a crime thriller film that meets the essential criteria for the genre. At its centre is a top cop, Assistant Commissioner Abraham Ozler (Jayaram), who is haunted by the memories of a personal tragedy. A critical mistake by the otherwise impeccable officer results in the loss of his wife and daughter, plunging him into depression and chronic insomnia. While battling his inner demons, Ozler encounters a case where a young man is brutally murdered by someone who leaves behind not many clues except for a greeting card with a few words inscribed in Malayalam. As Ozler and his team delve into the investigation, they discover a pattern as more people fall victim to similar crimes, indicating a common perpetrator. Despite their efforts to unravel the mystery, obstacles impede their progress. Gradually, they piece together the puzzle, leading to startling revelations."
"Telugu audience will be spoilt for choice this Makar Sankranti as Mahesh Babuâ€™s Guntur Kaaram, Venkatesh Daggubatiâ€™s Saindhav, Nagarjunaâ€™s Naa Saami Ranga and Teja Sajjaâ€™s Hanu Man are all set to release this festive weekend. Trade experts speak about which film will attract maximum footfall.
Mahesh Babu and director Trivikram Srinivasâ€™s Guntur Kaaram and Teja Sajjaâ€™s sci-fi fantasy film Hanu Man will release on January 12, whereas family-film Saindhav will release on January 13, followed by Naa Saami Ranga on January 14.

"Controversies are the lifeblood of Bigg Boss. Across languages, the reality show thrives on the disputes, fights, and quarrels that ensue between the contestants. Even if the participants resolve to be civil with each other, the Bigg Boss â€˜tasksâ€™ them in ways that would eventually lead to much-needed drama. Bigg Boss Tamil Season 7 had a lot of it. After a few dull seasons, the show seems to have gotten its mojo back. This time around even Kamal Haasan was part of controversies for allegedly siding with certain contestants.
As the season comes to a close on Sunday with a grand finale, hereâ€™s a look at some of the controversial moments of the season:"
"People watching the Golden Globes werenâ€™t happy with first-time host Jo Koyâ€™s monologue on Sunday. He made a sexist joke about the yearâ€™s top movie â€“ Barbie, and since Greta Gerwigâ€™s film fights against gender stereotypes, many viewers thought Koyâ€™s joke was tasteless and unnecessary. The joke in question was: â€œOppenheimer is based on the 721-page Pulitzer Prize-winning book about the Manhattan Project â€” and â€˜Barbieâ€™ is about a plastic doll with big boobies.â€
Greta has reacted to the statement and instead of roasting or giving a fitting reply, the director kept things simple. She said on BBC Radio 4, â€œWell, heâ€™s not wrong. Sheâ€™s the first doll that was mass-produced with breasts, so he was right on. And you know, I think that so much of the project of the movie was unlikely because it is about a plastic doll.â€

"The recent â€˜Koffee With Karan 8â€™ featured legendary actresses Zeenat Aman and Neetu Kapoor together on the coffee couch for the first time. The stars talked about their experiences in the 70s, made surprising revelations, got nostalgic, and shared untold stories from Bollywoodâ€™s golden era. Neetu won both gift hampers and nailed the rapid-fire round with immediate and heartfelt answers.
In the rapid-fire segment, Karan asked Neetu interesting questions. He asked, â€œIf you were to recruit actors of the current generation, who would be your fashion stylist?â€ Neetu immediately says, â€œDeepika Padukone.â€ When asked, â€œFitness coach?â€ Neetu answered, â€œAnushka. I find her very fit.â€
Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika dated when they first worked together in Bachna Ae Haseeno. Although they broke up later, they still collaborated in successful films like Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani and Tamasha. Ranbir tied the knot with Alia Bhatt in 2022.

Karan said, â€œNo one can ever have that now. Now we have the trolls. I donâ€™t think fans these days are as invested as they were in those days. Because they never saw any of you. They didnâ€™t know where you lived. There was no spotting.â€ Zeenat said, â€œStars were stars. They were not seen.â€ Neetu agreed and added, â€œThere was some kind of a mystery we actors had.

"Nayanthara-starrer Annapoorani: The Goddess of Food has been removed from Netflix amid allegations that it hurts religious sentiments. The film released theatrically on December 1 and started streaming on Netflix from December 29.

"A pitch-black comedy, garnished by â€˜payaâ€™ soup over a dream serving of Manoj Bajpayee and Konkona Sensharma, and dressed with murder and mayhem? Sign me up already, Iâ€™d thought gleefully when I heard of 2024â€™s new web series, â€˜Killer Soupâ€™, directed by Abhishek Chaubey. And it crushes me to say this, but this concoction, which promised so much flavour and freshness, only bubbled up for me intermittently.
First, the plus points. The picturesque setting, in a small town close to Madurai called Mainjur, is perfect for a twisty tale dotted with dodgy characters and dodgier doings. Husband-and-wife duo Swathi (Konkona Sensharma) and Prabhakar aka Prabhu Shetty (Manoj Bajpayee) are in the middle of what seems like a permanent argument, her dreaming of a restaurant of her own, him trying to figure out how to get out of a multi-crore â€˜ghaplaâ€™. Prabhuâ€™s older brother, the street-smart, foul-mouthed Arvind Shetty (Saiyaji Shinde) is of no help, holding the family purse-strings close, and his art-loving daughter Apeksha aka Apu (Anula Navelkar) even closer, refusing to let her follow her heart. Arvindâ€™s long-time factotum, the gravelly-voiced Lucas (Lal), knows where the skeletons are buried, and is a keeper of past secrets."
"Director Rohit Shetty has addressed allegations that his Singham films glorify police brutality and encounter killings, and said that he knows what the police force goes through, and has observed officers at close quarters. He said that he agrees with the idea of instilling â€˜fearâ€™ in the populace, and that he is willing to get â€˜trolledâ€™ for his beliefs. The filmmaker is best known for his shared universe of cop movies, which includes two Singham films, Simmba, Sooryavanshi, and the upcoming Indian Police Force series and a third installment in the Singham series.
In an interview with Film Companion, Rohit was asked about these complaints, and he said, â€œIâ€™m clear in my head about what Iâ€™m saying. All of us here are cultured people, but that life is a totally different life. Imagine if youâ€™re going to office and youâ€™re meeting a druggie, a rapist, someone who has chopped the head of an innocent person. When you deal with those kinds of people, you have a different frame of mind altogether.â€

"Saisha Shinde, who works as a fashion designer in the movies, transitioned a few years ago. Earlier, Saisha went by Swapnil and was fairly known in the fashion world. In a conversation with Tisca Chopra on her YouTube channel, Saisha recalled that time when the world was yet to know about her transition but during one of her fittings with Aishwarya Rai, the actor made sure that she used the correct pronouns and the correct name for the designer. When Aaradhya joined her mother during the fitting, Aishwarya introduced Saisha with her correct pronouns.
Saisha shared with Tisca, â€œIt had not come out in the papers. It was only my close knit friends in the industry who knew about it and I had fittings with Aishwarya. So I made sure I told her manager that get ready, itâ€™s not Swapnil who is going to come, it is Saisha who is going to come. Make sure that maâ€™am is okay, everyoneâ€™s okay, because I donâ€™t want to shock anyone.â€

Neetu also addressed Jaya Bachchanâ€™s frequent face-offs with paps and said that Jaya is a lovely person.
During a segment, Karan asked about their friendship with Rekha. Neetu took a trip down the memory lane and said, â€œI really donâ€™t know how it started. She was just a very friendly person. She is a very sweet and warm person. She would just drop by without informing me. So she was just like one of those girls, and she was very funny. She would do a lot of mimicry.â€ Zeenat agreed with Neetu and said, â€œShe came to my home on Nepean Sea Road.â€

"Director Rohit Shetty said that he missed the good old days, when the film industry was more of a unit than it is today. He said that while he appreciates the technological advances that have made everybodyâ€™s job easier, he looks back on the days when filmmakers would come to each otherâ€™s aid with nostalgia. In an interview, the blockbuster filmmaker said that he values the â€˜guru-shishya paramparaâ€™ of Indian culture, and that he has retained the same core team for decades.
Chatting with Film Companion ahead of the release of his big-budget streaming series Indian Police Force, Rohit revealed a humorous anecdote about reaching out to director Vidhu Vinod Chopra, whom he considers his â€˜seniorâ€™, after watching his film 12th Fail. Recalling his interaction with the filmmaker, Rohit said, â€œHeâ€™s our senior. We have grown up admiring Parinda. Weâ€™d gone on the set of 1942: A Love Story. I still remember, there was a strike, but he was allowed to shoot because it was such a massive set. I know Manoj Sharma very well; 12th Fail is about him. He told me I should reach out to Vidhu sir, and heâ€™d be happy to hear that I liked the film. He said, â€˜Tereko achi lagi picture?â€™ I said, â€˜Haan sirâ€™. He said, â€˜Chal ab wine ki bottle bhejâ€™. Thatâ€™s the senior-junior thing I miss.â€

"When Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Pathaan released in 2023, Hindi cinema was going through one of its worst phases but everything changed after the filmâ€™s release as it did unprecedented business at the box office. At a recent event, when asked about what was going through his head before the release of the YRF film, Shah Rukh said that he was â€œscaredâ€ but once Pathaan took over the box office, it was nothing but celebration for him, producer Aditya Chopra and director Siddharth Anand.
Shah Rukh then jokingly shared a story that while playing poker with Aditya and Siddharth, he was ready to bet Rs 5 lakh after Pathaanâ€™s success. He immediately said that this was a joke and he didnâ€™t actually bet money while playing the game. â€œAfter about 2-3 days, it became just unbelievable. We were like â€˜oh, these are the numbers, no, this canâ€™t beâ€™. Poker mein 5 lakh ki chaal. I swear we donâ€™t play with money this is a joke everyone,â€ he said with a laugh at News 18â€™s event.

"Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s three releases of 2023 had the actor celebrating patriotism in different ways. In Pathaan, he played a RAW agent who is protecting his country against the bad guy, in Jawan, he reminded people about their duty to vote responsibly and in Dunki, he spoke about loving oneâ€™s country as opposed to looking to move to another country. So when at a recent event, SRK was honoured as the â€˜Indian of the Yearâ€™, the actor spoke about his patriotism.
At News 18â€™s event, Shah Rukh said, â€œI donâ€™t just feel like the Indian of the year. I feel I have been the Indian of all the years gone by. And I will be the Indian for all the years to come. I am actually, ladies and gentleman, the Indian for all ages.â€ The crowd cheered for the star and he proceeded to thank them.

"Yesteryear actors Neetu Kapoor and Zeenat Aman appeared on the latest episode of Karan Joharâ€™s talk show â€˜Koffee with Karanâ€™. It was a mix of sizzling gossip, engaging conversations, and the timeless divas added vintage charm to the show. Neetu opened up about her granddaughter Raha Kapoor and shared what she wished Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor would take from her marriage with Rishi Kapoor.
When Karan questioned Neetu about the â€˜one thingâ€™ from her marriage that she wished Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor would embrace, the veteran actor said,  â€œNothing. Because in todayâ€™s day and age, do what you want to do. Just be happy. And also, every generation is different.

"Shah Rukh Khan has been a Hindi film hero for over 30 years, and while the actor is known for playing quintessential romantic leads, he has played a few villainous roles as well. But, SRK has largely stayed away from glorifying negative roles in the latter part of his career. At a recent event, where Shah Rukh Khan was honoured as â€˜The Indian of the Yearâ€™, the actor said that if he were to play a negative character, he would make sure that the character â€œdies a dogâ€™s death.â€ It appeared that the actor was taking a dig at director Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s controversial blockbuster Animal, which has been criticised for glorifying the morally reprehensible behaviour of its protagonist.
At a News18 event, Shah Rukh said, â€œI am a guy who is hopeful and tells happy stories. The heroes I play do good things, they give hope and happiness. If I play a bad guy, I make sure he suffers a lot, he dies a dogâ€™s death, because I believe goodness begets goodness. And I believe badness deserves a kick in the back side.â€ He continued, â€œI should play honest roles that give people courage to dream. I should keep working hard quietly with the hope that life doesnâ€™t topple my apple cart anytime soon.â€

"Shah Rukh Khan and veteran director Mani Ratnam worked together over 26 years ago in the film Dil Se, and fans of the two stalwarts have been waiting for them to collaborate again. Recently, at an event where both SRK and Mani Ratnam were honoured, the two spoke about working together again, and the conversation took a rather hilarious turn.

"Manoj Bajpayee said that he wouldâ€™ve been more than happy to return to the Delhi theatre scene after playing a small role in director Shekhar Kapurâ€™s Bandit Queen, but the filmmaker knocked some sense into him, and encouraged him to try his luck in the films. Manoj said that heâ€™d become something of a â€˜starâ€™ in Delhi, but didnâ€™t realise that theatre alone couldnâ€™t support a decent standard of life. In a chat with his Killer Soup co-star Konkona Sensharma for Indian Express, the actor recalled the advice he received from Kapur.
He said, â€œMumbai was the end-goal, but somewhere along the way, I forgot. I was enjoying myself so much in Delhi. But Shekhar Kapur, he took us all in Bandit Queen, and one night in Chambal, we were sitting an chilling with him, and then he started asking hard questions. He asked us all, â€˜What are your plans after the film is wrapped?â€™ And all of us, in unison, said that weâ€™ll go back and do theatre.â€

"Speaking at the audio launch of Captain Miller, Dhanush said that he was glad to have gotten hold of Arun Matheshwaran before other heroes. The actor also compared Arunâ€™s attitude to director Vetrimaaranâ€™s boldness and arrogance. â€œIdhu sambhavam panra kai,â€ said Dhanush. The actor is thoroughly impressed by Arun. The proof is in the fact that the two are teaming up again for a film, and thatâ€™s not even the sequel or prequel of Captain Miller. The respect is mutual as Arun heaped praise on his hero while speaking to Indianexpress.com. Other than Captain Miller, the director also put forth his thoughts about the obsession with pan-Indian cinema and violence.

"There is a Mrunal Thakur story that begins in the restroom of a Mumbai hotel. Days before the premiere of her debut film Love Sonia in 2018, the actor bumped into a journalist colleague after a packed afternoon of media interviews. Mrunal was already a known TV face by then, but shared about being nervous transitioning to films, especially with an unconventional movie. She could have chosen to wait for a safer option, but something about the film â€œspokeâ€ to her, she said.
Six years and a dozen films later, it is easy to map the rise of Mrunal Thakurâ€” the Marathi mulgi who has whipped up a Telugu storm by following her heart, even if it defies industry norms.

"A tendency to misdirect dilutes Appleâ€™s new crime-thriller series, Criminal Report. Written by Paul Rutman, the eight-episode show pits two London detectives â€” one a veteran of the police force and the other a wet-behind-the-ears rookie â€” against each other, when a seemingly dead and buried old murder case beckons from beyond the grave. What follows is a cat-and-mouse game that functions better as a psychological thriller than as a socially responsible police procedural.
Played by Cush Jumbo, Detective Sergeant June Lenker comes across a distress call from a young woman, who tells the operator in hushed tones that her life is in danger. Her boyfriend, she claims, is also responsible for a murder of another young woman that took place over a decade ago. A Black man by the name of Errol Mathis was convicted and sentenced to 24 years in prison for that crime, but the woman believes that Mathis is innocent. DS Lenker discovers that the investigating officer in the case was the infamous Detective Inspector Daniel Hegarty, a no-nonsense Glaswegian played in the show by the searingly intense Peter Capaldi."
"Warner Bros Discovery said on Tuesday it had struck a deal with Tom Cruise, one of Hollywoodâ€™s most bankable actors, to develop and produce original and franchise theatrical films in 2024.
The film partnership with Cruise marks a coup for Warner Bros Motion Picture Groupâ€™s co-chairs, Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy, and fulfills CEO David Zaslavâ€™s oft-stated desire to work with top talent behind the camera and in front of the camera.
â€œInking a deal with arguably the biggest movie star in the world, Tom Cruise, is hugely significant,â€ said Comscore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian.

Tom Cruise, who played a leading role in such films as Top Gun, The Last Samurai and the Mission: Impossible series, will occupy an office on the Warner Bros Discovery lot in Burbank, as have stars such as Clint Eastwood and Frank Sinatra.
Across his five-decade career, Cruiseâ€™s movies have earned more than $12 billion globally, with the 2022 release of Top Gun: Maverick, grossing nearly $1.5 billion, according to measurement firm Comscore. His most recent film, Mission: Impossible â€” Dead Reckoning Part One brought in a more earthbound $568 million in worldwide box office proceeds.

The arrangement with Warner Bros is non-exclusive, with Cruise working on the next installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise for Paramount Pictures, according to one source.
Warner Bros and the other major studios are working to rebound from a protracted work stoppage, as Hollywood writers and later, its actors, walked off the job in 2023.
Writers and actors from Hollywood went on strike demanding higher wages and protection against the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in filmmaking.
The dual strikes shut down a large portion of film and television production, halted late-night talk shows and forced broadcast networks to fill TV slots with repeats of reality shows.

The strikes led to a delay in Tom Cruiseâ€™s next Mission Impossible film as production house Paramount Global also bore the brunt of one of the longest work stoppages in the U.S. entertainment industry history.

"With the family week happening on Bigg Boss 17, contestants might have an emotional upheaval. Ankita Lokhande, Vicky Jain, and Abhishek Kumar will be paid a visit by their moms, while Munawar Faruqui and Mannara Chopraâ€™s sisters will enter the house. Indianexpress.com recently spoke to Mannaraâ€™s younger sister Mitali about her journey, the betrayals her elder sister faced on the show, and even the Mannara-Ankita rivalry.
Talking about the rivalry between Ankita and Mannara, Mitali said, â€œThere are certain areas of Ankita where one could see she is insecure. Even recently, when Mannara and Vicky were sharing a brother-sister bond, Ankitaâ€™s possessive behaviour could be seen. Ankita always keeps highlighting that Mannara is fake, so when there is an action, there is a reaction too. I feel Ankita is very insecure and possessive, she has a problem with Vicky talking to others.â€"

"Shah Rukh Khan, who was recently honoured with an award, has spoken up about the arrest of his son Aryan Khan back in 2021. While Shah Rukh has had successful films last year, the actor has limited his interaction with the media and has only chosen to speak directly to his fans via social media. On Wednesday, when Shah Rukh received a special award from News18, the actor addressed the difficult times that his family has seen in the last few years and shared the lesson he learnt during this time.
â€œThe last 4-5 years have been a bit of a ride for me and my family. Iâ€™m sure for some of you also because of Covid. Most of my films flopped. Analysts started writing my death knells,â€ he said as he compared the trade analysts to â€œidiotsâ€. He then addressed the problems he faced on a â€œpersonalâ€ level as he presumably spoke about Aryanâ€™s arrest back in 2021 during the Cordelia cruise drugs bust. Aryan, who was behind bars for almost a month, was later cleared of all charges.

"Javed Akhtar, who recently attended an event to honour director Mani Ratnam for his achievement in cinema, said that for decades, the Hindi film industry was â€œconvinced of our superiorityâ€ but all of that changed when Mani Ratnam started making movies and made them feel like â€œilliterate childrenâ€.
Speaking at an event for News 18, Javed said, â€œBombay film industry people have been very complacent and sure of ourselves. We used to be completely convinced of our superiority. And then, a director came from Tamil Nadu, he slapped us hard on our face with the kind of work we had never seen.â€ The veteran writer called the directorâ€™s work â€œunprecedentedâ€ and said, â€œWe were very sure of our technical superiority. He made us feel like illiterate children.â€
Javed Akhtar said that in the film industry, success comes to many but only those who have done some â€œexceptional workâ€ can sustain that success. â€œIt wont be politically right but I can give you names of ten directors who have made number of superhits but nobody remembers them. In the film industry, it is not only success that sustains you, success with some exceptional work, and that is by Mani Ratnam,â€ he said.

Mani Ratnam returned the compliments and requested Javed to come back to screenplay writing. Javed, along with Salim Khan, wrote some of the most popular Hindi films in the 1970s including Sholay, Deewar, among others.
He said, â€œJaved saab, I think we need you back writing screenplay. It will help us a lot. Especially in these times, when we are talking of just numbers, I think we need Javed saab.â€
When asked when he would be willing to make his next film, Mani Ratnam joked that he will do so when Javed Akhtar writes a screenplay for him. Mani is now looking forward to his next film with Kamal Haasan.

Javed had recently criticised Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Animal for its misogynistic content. At the 9th Ajanta-Ellora International Film Festival, he said, â€œIf thereâ€™s a film in which a man asks a woman to lick his shoe or if a man says itâ€™s okay to slap a womanâ€¦ and the film is a super hit, thatâ€™s dangerous.â€

â€œSir was very clear that you donâ€™t have to imitate Shraddha maâ€™am. You have to take inspiration from her character but you have to build your own character. For my prep, I met Shraddha maâ€™am many times. I would take notes. The first time I met her and Manoj sir, I took a notebook and for six hours, we were talking and I asked her everything about her life.

"One of the greatest playback singers in the history of Indian cinema, KJ Yesudas turned 83 on Wednesday. On the occasion, Yesudas virtually participated in a special event organized in Kochi, where several prominent personalities, including actors, directors, and music composers, took part. The singer, donning his trademark white kurta in the live video, expressed gratitude for everyoneâ€™s birthday wishes. During the function, his son and singer Vijay Yesudas cut the birthday cake on his fatherâ€™s behalf.
Having recorded over 25,000 film songs, Carnatic music bhajans, and other devotional songs, he has also sung in Arabic, English, Latin, and even Russian, besides Indian languages like Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Kannada, Bengali, and Odiya, throughout his over-six-decade-long career.
Only in Express | Who is Abraham Ozler? Director Midhun Manuel Thomas breaks down his new Jayaram film and other thrillers
Known as â€œganagandharvanâ€ (celestial singer) to millions of fans worldwide, Yesudas shared a profound bond with music composer Raveendran, who crafted some of the singerâ€™s most renowned songs. Their best tracks included â€œThenum Vayambumâ€, â€œEzhu Swarangalumâ€, â€œSukhamo Deviâ€, â€œAzhake Ninmizhiâ€, â€œOlikkunnuvoâ€, â€œEtho Nidrathanâ€ and â€œRamakadhaâ€.

Nevertheless, it was the songs â€œHarimuraleeravamâ€ from Aaraam Thampuran (1997) and â€œPramadhavanamâ€ from His Highness Abdullah (1990) that garnered them the most acclaim, earning a special place in the history of Malayalam cinema and the hearts of Malayalees worldwide.
Despite Raveendranâ€™s passing in 2005, Yesudas still cherishes their friendship deeply. This emotional attachment became evident to all when the singer was moved to tears after performing â€œPramadhavanamâ€ live on stage a few years back.
While singing the song at the Raveendra Sangeetha Sandhya event, organised by the Mazhavil Manorama television channel as a tribute to Raveendran, Yesudas was joined on stage by its lyricist Kaithapram Damodaran Namboothiri.
Towards the end of the song, Yesudas, visibly moved, expressed that he sensed Raveendranâ€™s presence with them on stage. He remarked with a lump in his throat, â€œThis song marked my comeback. Raveendran demonstrated that songs relying solely on the singersâ€™ voices, without theatrics, can captivate audiences.â€

Yesudas began his music career with the Malayalam song â€œJathi Bhedam Matha Dweshamâ€ in 1961 and sang mainly in Tamil, Telugu and Kannada films, apart from songs in other languages as well. Some of his well-known Hindi songs, which went on to become hits, include â€œJab Deep Jale Aanaâ€ and â€œGori Teraâ€.
He was honoured with the Padma Vibhushan in 2017 and is a recipient of eight national awards, 25 Kerala state awards, five state awards of Tamil Nadu, and four of Andhra Pradesh.

However, on his home turf, the film will compete at the box office with Mahesh Babuâ€™s Guntur Kaaram, Venkatesh Daggubatiâ€™s Saindhav and Nagarjunaâ€™s Naa Saami Ranga. But the clash doesnâ€™t bother Teja because he believes the Telugu audience has an appetite to watch multiple films during Sankranthi.

A notable feature of the house is its deliberate lack of a television or other entertainment sources in the living room, making it exclusively reserved for conversations. â€œI really value and cherish having meals together as a family. To be very honest, I did not do enough of that as a kid myself,â€ he told Architectural Digest India, as he showed it the dining room at his home.

They recently shared how Sandeep was careful about not offending the Sikh community and often confirmed with them if they could do what he asked them to before shooting a scene.
Amanjot, while speaking to Siddharth Kannan, shared that Sandeep believes that Sikhs are â€œnot meantâ€ for comic roles. The filmmaker told the actor, â€œI feel Sardars are not made for comedy. Their attitude, nature, their history, it is not made for comedy. I donâ€™t look at Sardars for comedy.â€ Amanjot says Sandeep was able to say this as he knows a lot about sardars. This knowledge, the actor said, came from his spending a lot of time with his Sikh and Punjabi friends during his college days.

Since 2020, Midhun has significantly enhanced his reputation as a screenwriter and two films he penned â€” Garudan and Phoenix â€” hit the screens in November 2023, achieving success and garnering positive responses. Notably, neither of these movies bore any resemblances to Anjaam Pathiraa, despite being thrillers, heightening expectations for Ozler, penned by Randheer Krishnan.

"Actor Manoj Bajpayee recalls living in â€˜povertyâ€™ while working in the Delhi theatre circuit, and then after he moved to Mumbai at the insistence of Bandit Queen director Shekhar Kapur. The actor said that initially, the poverty didnâ€™t bother him, because he was so immersed in his work, but over time, he began to realise the importance of financial security. In a chat with his Killer Soup co-star Konkona Sensharma for Indian Express, Manoj looked back on his time at Delhi University, and then experiencing the customary struggle after he moved to Mumbai.
He said that he values theatre more than cinema, because in cinema, he feels he is too dependent on other departments. â€œIt really prepares you, physically, mentally, emotionally. It really aligns you, and that happens to every actor. But the days were of complete poverty. But those days were when you could not get the time to think about poverty. If you donâ€™t have money to eat, youâ€™re not thinking about eating, because youâ€™re so involved and engrossed in what youâ€™re doing, youâ€™re forgetting that you didnâ€™t have food.â€ Ironically, Manoj hasnâ€™t had dinner in 14 years for health reasons.

"Director Sriram Raghavan said that itâ€™s generally a bad idea to write films with certain actors in mind, because you invariably end up writing in cliches, or serving that actorâ€™s tropes. He recalled a story about being approached by Sunny Deol, who was impressed with a documentary heâ€™d directed in the early â€™90s. He also opened up about casting Varun Dhawan in Badlapur, even though heâ€™d initially designed the character for an older actor.
In an interview with Galatta Plus, Sriram was asked about his quirky casting, which often goes against the grain. His new film, Merry Christmas, features the unlikely pair of Katrina Kaif and Vijay Sethupathi. He said, â€œIf I keep an actor in mind on the blank page, itâ€™s damn tough. You end up writing cliched stuff thatâ€™s already been done. Many years back, Iâ€™d not even made a single film, Sunny Deol happened to see (the Raman Raghav documentary), he called me and said, â€˜Letâ€™s do somethingâ€™.â€

"Director Sriram Raghavan opened up about the process of filming two versions of his upcoming thriller, Merry Christmas, back-to-back. Sriram first shot the film in Hindi, and then, mainly to mitigate escalating costs, shot a modified version in Tamil. He addressed the dryness that had set into the crew when they started work on the Tamil film, and said that the process was particularly â€˜torturousâ€™ for Katrina Kaif, who even suggested that he cast a different actor in her place.
In an interview with Galatta Plus, Sriram said that theyâ€™d erected a set for the film, which went unused for several months because of scheduling conflicts. This escalated the filmâ€™s budget, which was a source of stress for the filmmaker, whoâ€™d envisioned it as a relatively small-scale project. â€œThe rewriting continued till the last day. When Vijay Sethupathi came in, it was still a Hindi film. But during the second wave, weâ€™d built a set, but for three months we couldnâ€™t shoot because Katrinaâ€™s dates were clashing with Tiger and Vijay was also not freeâ€¦ So, 70% of the set was done, but we were prohibited from shooting, so we had to bring (the set) down. Costs were going up, but nothing was on screen,â€ he said.

"Ankita Lokhande and Vicky Jainâ€™s relationship has been going through a rough patch ever since they entered the televisionâ€™s most controversial reality show, Bigg Boss 17. Recently, their mothers entered the show during the ongoing â€˜Family Weekâ€™ and shared their opinion with their children. However, after coming out of the house, Vickyâ€™s mother said she never wanted her son to marry Ankita. She also said that the Pavitra Rishta actor has been trying to win the sympathy of the audience by repeatedly talking about her former boyfriend and late actor, Sushant Singh Rajput.
â€œAnkita has been naming Sushant. Looks like she is trying to gain sympathy for herself. Sushant is anyway gone,â€ Vicky Jainâ€™s mother told Saas Bahu Saazish after coming out of the Bigg Boss house. She also spoke about Ankita hitting Vicky, after discussing it with the actor inside the house. She said that since husbands are considered god in India, Ankita should not have hit her husband. â€œIt is unfair. We live in India. Your husband is a devta, you are beating him.â€

"Director Sriram Raghavan opened up about telling Saif Ali Khan that heâ€™d changed his mind about casting him in Merry Christmas, after having shook on it previously. In an interview, the filmmaker said that Saif was understandably annoyed, but the best that he could do in that moment was to assure Saif that heâ€™d try his best to make it up to him. Sriram eventually cast Vijay Sethupathi as the filmâ€™s male lead, opposite Katrina Kaif.
In an interview with Galatta Plus, the director was asked about his writing process, and how the character evolved over time. â€œThis story is from a different era. If Iâ€™d just taken the bare-bones plot, I couldâ€™ve made an episode of CIDâ€¦ I love Saif as an actor, although our last film didnâ€™t work. That time he wasnâ€™t doing so much, so I thought heâ€™d be fun. I went to meet him, he loved the story, said, â€˜Great, letâ€™s do itâ€™. And then, I started fleshing it out.â€

"â€œSomething or someone is targeting our scientists,â€ a voice over cautions as dead bodies are discovered. â€œThere is someone behind everything, you just have to dig.â€ Netflix on Wednesday dropped the trailer of its highly anticipated new series 3 Body Problem, which has Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and DB Weiss attached as showrunners and executive producers.
Billed as a thrilling story that â€œredefines sci-fi drama with its layered mysteries and genre-bending high stakesâ€, the eight-episode show is based on the acclaimed international bestselling book trilogy, The Three-Body Problem by Chinese author Cixin Liu. Alexander Woo (of The Terror: Infamy, True Blood fame) has co-created the series with Benioff and Weiss and is also the executive producer and writer.

The official synopsis of 3 Body Problem reads, â€œA young womanâ€™s fateful decision in 1960s China reverberates across space and time into the present day. When the laws of nature inexplicably unravel before their eyes, a close-knit group of brilliant scientists join forces with an unorthodox detective to confront the greatest threat in humanityâ€™s history.â€
The over two-minute-long trailer, then, sets up the mind-bending world of the series, amping up it stakes and making it clear that it is going to be a visually stunning journey into several timelines and continents. A handy guidebook of the characters, arcs and timelines perhaps would be recommended, as the show is dense with its plot and mind-boggling with the how it intercut across time and geography.

3 Body Problem stars Jovan Adepo, John Bradley, Liam Cunningham, Rosalind Chao, Eiza GonzÃ¡lez, Jess Hong, Marlo Kelly, Alex Sharp, Sea Shimooka, Zine Tseng, Saamer Usmani, Benedict Wong and Jonathan Pryce among others.
3 Body Problem is set to premiere on Netflix on March 21. This is the first show for David Benioff and DB Weiss as showrunners after the global sensation Game of Thrones, that ended in 2019.

"While the 81st Golden Globe Awards ceremony honored the best in film and American television productions of 2023 in Hollywood, this year a drama unfolded after a video of Selena Gomez whispering something in Taylor Swiftâ€˜s ears went viral on the internet. However, Selena has now offered a clarification that contrary to the reports doing rounds that she was gossiping about Kylie Jenner and TimothÃ©e Chalamet, she wasnâ€™t.
Reacting to an Instagram post by E! News, which read, â€œWas Selena Gomez gossiping about Kylie Jenner and TimothÃ©e Chalamet at the Golden Globes? Hereâ€™s the truth.â€ She commented, â€œI told Taylor about two of my friends who hooked up. Not that thatâ€™s anyone business.â€

â€” Pop Base (@PopBase) January 9, 2024
Earlier, there were reports that Kylie stopped boyfriend TimothÃ©e from taking a photo with his A Rainy Day in New York (2019) co-star Selena at the prestigious event. Following the clip, people assumed that Selena gossiped about the couple with Taylor. However, sources had told People Magazine that Selena â€˜never even saw or spoke to themâ€™.
TimothÃ©e also reacted to the drama going viral on social media. He denied that there was any problem between him, Kylee and Selena. When TMZ asked him if everything was â€œcoolâ€ between him and Selena, he said, â€œya, of course.â€ On asking if there was any beef between Selena and Kylie, he said, â€œNo, theyâ€™re good.â€
Selena was nominated for best performance by a female actor in a television musical or comedy for her role in the series Only Murders in the Building at the Golden Globes. Here, she was was seen chit-chatting with celebrities like Taylor Swift, Florence Pugh and Meryl Streep, among others. She attended the award night with her boyfriend Benny Blanco.

"When it was announced that Sunny Deolâ€™s Gadar 2 and Pankaj Tripathiâ€™s OMG 2 would be released on the same day, it was seen as one of the biggest box-office clashes of last year. However, when the two films were finally released in the theatres, Gadar 2 became a sensation at ticket counters, and OMG 2 â€” riding on critical acclaim â€” managed to stay steady at the box office but could not match up to the numbers of nationalist drama. Amit Rai, who directed OMG 2, feels his film could not grow financially because of the Central Board for Film Certification (CBFC).
OMG 2, also starring Akshay Kumar, received an â€˜Aâ€™ rating from CBFC, which Rai believes kept his target audience, the families, away from the cinema halls, leading to the filmâ€™s less-than-expected performance at the box office. He told DNA in a recent interview, â€œIf it wasnâ€™t an A-certificate film, then maybe it would have been neck and neck with Gadar 2, minting money at the box office because families would have come for it.â€ While Gadar 2 earned Rs 686 crore worldwide, OMG 2 could earn Rs 221.75 crore.

Though now he wants the â€˜bygones be bygonesâ€™, Rai also felt the censor board â€œkilledâ€ half of his family audience by giving it an A-rating. He added, â€œThe censor board hurt me financially too and in terms of content as well.â€ CBFC reportedly suggested 27 changes in the film which deals with sex education, among other issues.
Also read | CBFC member Vivek Agnihotri speaks against OMG 2â€™s A certificate, says decision comes from â€˜social, religious pressureâ€™
Earlier, Rai had shared that he sent many messages to CBFC chief Prasoon Joshi requesting a U/A certificate for OMG 2. But his request fell on deaf ears. â€œI remember clearly that I folded my hands. I told them that you are doing the wrong thing because if this film goes on OTTâ€¦â€ he told Bollywood Hungama. The filmmaker even tried to get the filmâ€™s certification changed after its release but Joshi â€œnever respondedâ€ to his messages.
OMG 2 follows the journey of a father and son who are battling social taboos so teenagers can learn about sex education. Akshay plays the â€˜messenger of godâ€™ in the film. Yami Gautam portrays the role of a lawyer. She too was â€˜disheartenedâ€™ when the film was given an â€˜Aâ€™ certificate.

"The Bigg Boss 17 finale is inching closer, and contestant Ankita Lokhande has already found support in actor Kangana Ranaut, with whom she worked on the film Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi. Ankita and her husband Vicky Jain, who is also a contestant on the show, have had a tumultuous time in the Bigg Boss house. Kangana took to Instagram to share a clip of Vicky Jainâ€™s mother, where she is talking about why Ankita deserves to win the show.
For the unversed, Vicky Jain and Ankita Lokhande have been at loggerheads with each other since the show began, and have even brought up the topic of divorce in their conversations. In one of the episodes, both Ankita and Vickyâ€™s parents visited the house.

Ankita was seen talking with Vickyâ€™s mother in private, which eventually turned into an argument. Ankitaâ€™s mother-in-law was upset with the coupleâ€™s fights, and said, â€œJis din tumne laat maari thi na. Papa ne turant tumhari mummy ko phone kiye â€˜Tum apne pati ko aisi hi laat maarti thi?â€™ (The day you kicked Vicky, your father-in-law had called your mother and asked, â€˜Have you also kicked your husband like that)?â€ Ankita was not very comfortable with this conversation, and looked visibly upset. She had also said that there was no need to drag her mother into this.
But pained at the narrative being spun against Ankita and her mother-in-law, Kangana Ranaut posted a snippet of Ankitaâ€™s mother-in-law explaining why she deserves to win over Vicky.

Another statement by Vicky Jainâ€™s mother saying that she never supported their marriage has been making headlines. â€œWe were not in support. Vicky has not done it. We donâ€™t have a say in that. Everyone is seeing this but we havenâ€™t said anything to them even once. Their relationship will improve. If there is no problem, then it will improve. And we are sure that Vicky has done everything possible. Thatâ€™s the kind of person he is,â€ she said in Hindi, while talking to Pinkvilla.

"Dunki box office collection day 20. Superstar Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s third release of the year is now clocking numbers in the range of Rs 1 crore per day, as the comedy drama prepares to pretty much close its run at the box office. According to industry tracker Sacnilk, Dunki netted Rs 1.3 cr on its third Tuesday.
Director Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s film appears to have lost all steam after the holiday season bump. The filmâ€™s domestic total now stands at Rs 219.27 cr, which is around a third of what Shah Rukhâ€™s Jawan earned last year, and less than half of what Pathaan made a year ago. Till Monday, the film had grossed Rs 447.70 cr worldwide according to official figures by Red Chillies Entertainment. Both Jawan and Pathaan grossed more than Rs 1000 crore globally.
Indian Express Entertainment is now on WhatsApp Channels. Follow us for the latest news, interviews, reviews, photos and more.

After it crosses the Rs 450 cr mark in India, the film will then aim to break the record of another Hirani film, 3 Idiots. The Aamir Khan-starrer had grossed a whopping Rs 460 cr globally back in 2009. Dunki will cross 3 Idiots, but will fall short of Hiraniâ€™s last film, Sanju. The Ranbir Kapoor-starrer had minted Rs 588 cr worldwide in 2018.
On the global stage, Dunki is also likely to chase down the collections of Salman Khan-Katrina Kaif fronted Tiger 3, which had clocked Rs 464 cr last year. This, however, is still a disappointing number especially in the context of how box office in 2023 truly exploded, partly thanks to Shah Rukh himself.
Besides Jawan and Pathaan, Gadar 2 and Animal did business of Rs 686 cr and Rs 900 cr, respectively. Dunki has managed to deliver Rs 450 cr despite a clash with Salaar, and with average audience reception, though the expectations were sky high considering it was directed by Rajkumar Hirani.

"Director Prashanth Neelâ€™s Salaar: Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire had a thunderous opening at the box office, as it earned Rs 90.7 crore on the day of its release, breaking the record of Atleeâ€™s Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Jawan (Rs 75 crore). However, it could not maintain the momentum built during its first week, and is now struggling to pass the Rs 400 crore mark domestically. The movie will be further impacted by the wide slate of releases during the Sankranti/Pongal weekend.
Salaarâ€™s box office collection on day 19 was noted at Rs 2.15 crore, according to industry tracker Sacnilk. The filmâ€™s nett domestic collection now stands at Rs 397.80 crore, which means that it will finally pass the Rs 400 crore mark in the next day or two. The maximum footfall was seen during the night shows (17.43%) and the evening shows saw the minimum occupancy (14.27%). For the first time, the Tamil occupancy (16.40%) was higher than the Telugu occupancy (15.29%), while the occupancy in the Hindi-speaking regions fell to 9.84%.

The chances of the Prabhas and Prithviraj Sukumaran-led drama surpassing the collection of Rajinikanthâ€™s 2.0, look bleak. Released in 2018, 2.0 had earned Rs 407.05 crore in India.

The highest-earning Indian film is SS Rajamouliâ€™s Baahubali 2: The Conclusion, with a nett domestic collection of Rs 1030.42 crore.

"What if someone told you that the latest Salman Khan actioner can give you a ready reckoner on why democracy is better than dictatorship? Maneesh Sharmaâ€™s Tiger 3 is not just the popcorn-and-patriotism entertainer you always expected it to be, the latest Bhai film also expounds the idea that democracy needs to be protected against people who declare themselves to be the sole custodians of the country, making you hopeful for the future of Indian movies.
For many decades now, star-driven action films in India have been all about seeking revenge. It could be for the death of the heroâ€™s beloved, or any other woman; it could be some childhood trauma that has scarred him for life and he is now looking for comeuppance; or, it could be all about seeking retribution for oneâ€™s country. The last one has been frequently revisited in our films and has appealed to the masses. The idea of patriotism, however, has changed a fair bit in our movies and in 2023, this was particularly evident. The year started with Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Pathaan where a Pakistani agent, played by Deepika Padukone, had the crowd cheering for her when she joined forces with SRKâ€™s Indian agent to save humanity. A few months later, in Jawan, Shah Rukh gave a rousing monologue where he spoke directly to his fans about the importance of voting for the right candidate. The film did not shy away from taking shots at the corrupt troika of bureaucracy, politics and business. And the year ended with Salman Khan in Tiger 3 where his main mission was to save Pakistan from the evils of dictatorship.
Tiger 3 is an Indian film with an Indian hero at the center of its story but strangely enough, India has no stake in the story of this film. The many times when Tiger is asked as to why he cares about whatâ€™s happening in Pakistan, he comes up with a rather flimsy excuse, a reason he repeats many times in the film. It makes you wonder why Maneesh and Salman zeroed in on this subject for the third Tiger installment. In the film, the protagonist asks his crew, who are stand-ins for the audience, a question that immediately tells you about the central idea of this film. â€˜Democracy or dictatorship?â€™ asks Tiger and his crew responds in unison, â€˜democracy.â€™
ADVERTISEMENT
Salman Khan in a still from Tiger 3.
It is a rather strong statement when one of the most successful movie producing studios in the country decides to make a film where a choice as simple as this, at least for Indians who have been living in a democracy for over 75 years, needs to be reminded to the audience. The makers actually had to spell out why the need to have fair elections is essential and why democracy is better than having a dictator, the villain of this story, who might pretend to have good intentions. They underline that complete control in the hands of one person canâ€™t be good for the health of a nation.
Tiger 3 also makes you wonder why, despite being set in Pakistan where an Indian agent is saving their democracy, there is no sense of superiority from any of the Indian characters? Our extremely loud news channels like to compare the two nations often and even before watching one of those shrill shows, you can presume that itâ€™s all going to be about how India is better than its neighbour in the west. Tiger 3 gets an opportunity to do this many times over, yet chooses to walk away from it. Salman doesnâ€™t break into a monologue telling Pakistanis how they should learn from India and its democracy, and the film does not suggest that saving Pakistanâ€™s democracy will benefit India in any way. Was it because the writers and director felt that there was no need for this level of pettiness, or because they wanted their audience to actually think about the importance of democracy in a rapidly changing society?

By any measure, Tiger 3 is not a great film. The filmmaking is inept, the visual effects are laughable, the storytelling is convoluted and Salman canâ€™t summon the charisma that makes his fans swoon, but, despite all of that, Tiger 3 makes a statement that many of its contemporaries would shy away from. Bollywood is often criticised for being apolitical or swaying the way political wind is blowing, but decades from now, when the cinema of 2023 is examined again, this sense of dissent from something as mainstream as Tiger 3 wonâ€™t go unnoticed."
"It may be January, but for actor Vijay Sethupathi, itâ€™s very much a Merry Christmas. The actor â€” clearly the new darling of Hindi cinema audiences â€” is awaiting the release of the Sriram Raghavan film opposite Katrina Kaif, and enjoying the adulation that is coming his way. After Jawan and Farzi, and a rich filmography in South films, Vijay is the go-to guy for strong author-backed roles, but accepts he is still getting used to everything else that comes as a package deal with working in films.
Lauded for breaking the set template of how a Hindi film actor looks with his real and relatable appearance, Vijay confessed that the newfound love heâ€™s receiving for the way he looks acts like an â€œenergy drinkâ€ for him but remembers the time he was body- shamed for it. In this interview with indianexpress.com, he also opens up on how heâ€™s very conscious of what heâ€™s wearing, because he has a habit of showing up in â€œchappalsâ€ at functions, get-togethers and meetings.

"Thereâ€™s a thin line between self-awareness and self-satisfaction, and writer-director Dan Levyâ€™s debut feature, Good Grief, isnâ€™t able to straddle it. While awareness is a sign of emotional maturity, being smug about it is perhaps the most immature thing that a person can do. So, when a character in Good Grief makes an off-handed comment about a fictional movie in an early scene, describing it as â€˜cloying but well-intentionedâ€™, you canâ€™t help but wonder if thatâ€™s Levy with his guard up, pre-empting some of the criticism that could be lobbed in the direction of his film, which is out now on Netflix.
Itâ€™s a weepy about a 30-something who experiences a terrible loss, and then goes to Paris to process it. Levy stars as Marc, whose husband Oliver â€” a famed writer whose books are often turned into blockbuster films â€” dies tragically in a car accident in the filmâ€™s opening scene. After hard-cutting to a tragicomic title card, however, Good Grief jumps forward by a year, and dishes out some more bad news to a still-grieving Marc. Itâ€™s the kind of bad news that completely alters his perception of his late husband, and compels him to make an impromptu international trip.

"Chennai floods seem to have brought together Aamir Khan and Vishnu Vishal. The flood struck the area where Vishnu and Aamir were staying. For many it was shocker to see Aamir getting rescued from the flood along with Vishnu. Looks like during the hardship, the two actors became friends, and thus, Vishnu along with his wife were invited to Aamir Khanâ€™s daughter Ira Khanâ€™s wedding to Nupur Shikhare in Udaipur.
It is now clear why Vishnu is visibly absent from promoting his upcoming film Lal Salaam. The actor has gone out of town to attend the wedding in Udaipur along with his wife Jwala Gutta, who took to social media to share pictures from the wedding festivities.

In a recent interview, Pankaj was speaking of his college days in Bihar when he was a part of ABVP. â€œEveryone is a politician in Bihar,â€ the actor said as he spoke about the interest in politics in his home state.
When asked if Pankaj thought about joining politics at the time, the actor said that he wanted to pursue this career but after he was arrested once, he let go of that idea. â€œI never thought about entering politics at that time. There was a thought that I might proceed in this line but then there was an arrest and the cops beat me up so I left that thought there and then,â€ he shared with ANI.

"In 2022, when Akshay Kumar played the titular role in YRFâ€™s Samrat Prithviraj, directed by Chandraprakash Dwivedi, it was expected to be a film that would bring back the audience to the theatres after the dry spell of the pandemic but, it backfired and how! Two years later, the director has now opened up about the colossal failure of the movie and expressed how he raised many objections to producer Aditya Chopra during the making but since he did not have much power, he could not control the situation.
In a conversation with Mukesh Khanna on his YouTube channel, Dwivedi said that even before the release of the movie, the audience had picked up on many elements of the film and were criticising it. â€œThey were objecting to how Akshay was looking in the film. One of the objections was about how the actress (Manushi Chillar) was so much younger and Akshay, who was 55 then, was playing the role of a 26-year-old king. Then there was a question about his moustache as to why did he not have a real moustache. They even said that the frame of his body was nothing like Prithviraj. Today, honestly, I would like to confess that most of these objections were right,â€ he said.

"Shah Rukh Khan began his acting journey in television before making his mark in films and ultimately becoming the â€˜badshahâ€™ of Bollywood. In a recent interview, actor Mushtaq Khan shared an interesting anecdote from SRKâ€™s television days, revealing how the superstar turned down a role in a big film bankrolled by a reputed production house because he wasnâ€™t getting a meaty part.
Speaking about the same, Mushtaq told Digital Commentary, â€œI acted in a television show with Shah Rukh Khan called Umeed. We shot for the show in Nashik. I understood back then that he wonâ€™t stay here for long. He asked me one day about producer Pranlal Mehta. I told him he is a big producer. Shah Rukh said that he is getting a lot of calls from the Pranlal. I said, â€˜You are getting calls from him, go and do that project with him.â€™ He told me that he will wait and see, but I asked him not to wait any longer and just do the project. He then decided to think about it for 2-3 days before responding to the producer. After 4-5 days, he told me that he wonâ€™t be doing that project and I was shocked. I told him, â€˜Pagal ho gaeya hai (You have gone mad). You donâ€™t know how big is the production house and the director helming the film has delivered hits in the past.'â€

"With just two days left until the commencement of the Sankranti/Pongal weekend, during which a slew of films in different South Indian languages will be released, Prashanth Neelâ€™s Prabhas-starrer Salaar: Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire is struggling to surpass the Rs 400 crore mark in the domestic market. Even if it achieves this milestone by Friday, itâ€™s evident that Salaarâ€™s aspiration to become the highest-grossing Indian film, both domestically and globally, is unlikely to materialise.
As of 6 pm, the film has recorded a nett collection of Rs 1.35 crore in the domestic market on Tuesday, its 19th day in theatres, bringing Salaarâ€™s total collection in India to Rs 397 crore, according to industry tracker Sacnilk. The overall occupancy in the Telugu market for the day stands at a meagre 14.73 per cent, with morning shows recording 14.35 per cent and the rate rising to just 15.10 during afternoon showings. On Day 18, Salaar had minted Rs 2.4 crore in the domestic market. Globally, the film has earned Rs 687.51 crore, toppling Sunny Deolâ€™s Gadar 2, which earned Rs 686 crore worldwide.

"Recently ousted contestant from Bigg Boss 17, Anurag Dobhal, popularly known as The UK07 Rider, has shared his observations on the showâ€™s much-discussed couple, Ankita Lokhande and Vicky Jain. The couple has been making headlines due to their frequent and intense arguments on the reality show.
In an interview with Siddharth Kannan, Anurag expressed his thoughts on the dynamics of Ankita and Vickyâ€™s relationship. He said, â€œA husband and wife had to keep in mind what kind of a relationship they are showing to the audience. I will give an example of Neil and Aishwarya. They got a feedback on their relationship and they worked on that. They also fought a lot and there was disrespect also, but they didnâ€™t talk about divorce. When you say such things on national television, it canâ€™t be taken back. Now, since they have talked about divorce, people donâ€™t trust their relationship. I feel Vicky has disrespected Ankita a lot and she too have slapped him on the national television. Who does that? I donâ€™t think this relationship will survive outside the house.â€

"Actor Konkona Sensharma recalled how embarrassed she was about doing a Bengali-language thriller early in her career, and admitted that she was secretly praying that it never sees the light of day. In a chat with her Killer Soup co-star Manoj Bajpayee for Indian Express, Konkona admitted that she was a â€˜snobâ€™, and said that to some degree, she still is. â€œItâ€™s okay to have high standards,â€ she said, as she narrated an anecdote about bagging her first role as an adult, while she was still in college.
She said, â€œI got offered this film by a very lovely man, Subrata Sen. And the film went on to do very well. It was a Bengali thriller. It was about this teenager who was in love with an older man, and it was a little sensational type. Like negative character, stalking this older man. And I used to look down on all this. Here we were, doing seminars on theatre of the absurd, and the Dadaist movement, and surrealist movement and all that. And then, in Calcutta, between my second year and third yearâ€¦ It was a commercial film, sometimes quite silly. I literally remember standing in a studio in Calcutta and holding back tears, and hoping that this film never releases.â€

He said that heâ€™d never experienced anything like it, coming from a small town in Bihar. Manoj credited DU as being an â€˜instigatorâ€™ in his life, and said that during his time at the university, he discovered â€˜urban behaviour patterns, education, knowledge, dictionâ€¦â€™ Chatting with his Killer Soup co-star Konkona Sensharma for Indian Express, Manoj said that he wasnâ€™t fluent in English when he first arrived in Delhi, and that this was a source of great amusement for his fellow students.
But, he said, he had a self-deprecating streak, and would often allow himself to be mocked for his poor English-speaking skills. Many years later, he revealed, one of his old college roommates got in touch with him and said that he felt terrible for what happened. â€œIâ€™m from Bihar, so our pronunciation was all haywire. DU has played a major part in shaping me,â€ he said. â€œI always had this feeling that Iâ€™m lacking a lot, coming from a place that isnâ€™t exposed to this world. That sense of urgency was there in my mind that I had to reshape myself very fast, I have to adjust into this society very fast, I have to understand its ways very fastâ€¦â€

"Pakistani actor Fawad Khan, known for his successful stint in Pakistani television dramas and brief but impactful roles in Hindi films like Khoobsurat and Kapoor & Sons, recently discussed the popularity of Pakistani dramas in India in a recent interview.
During an interview Ahmad Ali Butt, Fawad explained the distinction between Indian television shows and Pakistani dramas and shed light on the factors that make the latter resonate with the Indian audience. He said. â€œThey make soap operas. They donâ€™t make mini-series. They donâ€™t make a 10-20 episode series. They used to make it in the past. Many actors, including Shah Rukh Khan did a series called Fauji, he did one or two TV projects. I believe Nana Patekar also did TV before entering films. I think during that time we also used to watch their dramas. Tab Doordarshan pakda jata tha thoda thoda in some places (We used to get signals of Doordarshan in some places). I am not saying that they evolved into a 24 hour The Bold And The Beautiful, Santa Barbara television presenceâ€¦ long episode soap operasâ€¦we finish the series in 26 episodes.â€

"Aamir Khanâ€™s work ethic has been a subject of both praise and debate in the film industry. While some view him as overly involved, others commend his dedication to the craft. In a recent interview with Digital Commentary, Bollywood actor Mushtaq Khan, who has collaborated with Aamir Khan on numerous films such as Dil Hai Ke Manta Nahin, Mann, Akele Hum Akele Tum and Baazi, shared insights into his experience working with the superstar. Complimenting Aamir Khanâ€™s deep involvement in his films, Mushtaq narrated an incident when the actor reached his house post-midnight just to narrate a scene he had revised.
Speaking about Aamirâ€™s work ethic, Mushtaq said, â€œI have done many films with Aamir Khan. In any film, doesnâ€™t matter who is the director or producer, he is fully involved. The best thing about Aamir Khan is that he wants the film to be good. He wants the scene to be good and he wants that if a scene has four artists they get their moments. For instance, if I have a scene then that will remain my scene. This is a big thing. When it is said that he interferes thatâ€™s not true.â€

"Itâ€™s a tale that is all too familiar. And yet, the familiarity offers no comfort. When a young, unassuming teacherâ€™s dance video goes viral, her life combusts. A closer look, however, reveals that the ramifications were not as sudden. As Sajini Shinde Ka Viral Video delves into the life of its titular character, the supposed disgraced teacher, the viewer is met with the disquieting realisation that the mores and morality that we often bind ourselves in were corroding Shindeâ€™s life already.
In many ways Sajini Shindeâ€™s (played by Radhika Madan) ordeal was her own. A teacher from a respectable school in Pune, who is later seen in a viral video dancing with two shirtless men on the bar top, isnâ€™t a predicament most of us find ourselves in. But being called out for straying far from the boundaries set for women by the society is a feeling many women are familiar with. Letting loose is a privilege â€” one that only a few of us enjoy, and mostly in the confines of our homes.

"Veteran screenwriter Javed Akhtar says the Hindi commercial cinema, contrary to what many would believe, is a true reflection of the society and if one maps the stories of each decade, a defining picture emerges of the times we live in. Today, Akhtar observed, movies are dotted with â€œmeaningless violenceâ€, which require deeper inspection.
Speaking during the 9th Ajanta-Ellora International Film Festival in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Akhtar, who, along with Salim Khan, birthed the â€˜Angry Young Menâ€™ hero of Bollywood and wrote fiercely anti-establishment movies, says current times signal some â€œfrustrationâ€ in people which is being channeled through violent films.

"Actor Katrina Kaif spoke about working with director Sriram Raghavan and co-star Vijay Sethupathi on Merry Christmas, and said that the filmmaker gave her â€˜homeworkâ€™ to better flesh out her character. Katrina is best known for her glamorous big-screen roles, but she occasionally forays into more dramatic territory. Merry Christmas is being seen as a rare character-driven film for her, while Sethupathi is more recognised for his quieter performances, despite occasionally appearing in big-budget entertainers.
In an interview with Film Companion, she was asked if Merry Christmas was difficult leap for her, after having played â€˜morally uprightâ€™ women in most of her past films. She said, â€œJust because a lot of the films Iâ€™ve been a part of havenâ€™t portrayed that, it doesnâ€™t mean that me as a person doesnâ€™t understand it, or doesnâ€™t relate to it, or hasnâ€™t experienced it. A lot of it came from discussions with Sriram sir. After our first meeting, where he narrated the film, he told me to write my own backstory for the character. He said, â€˜Tell me what you think, where she came from, who she is, why she does what she doesâ€™. That process really helped me understand the worldâ€¦â€

"Bollywood actor Pankaj Tripathi grew up in Biharâ€™s Belsand village in Gopalganj district. His father was a farmer and a priest, and his upbringing was rooted in simplicity. In a recent interview with India TV, the actor recounted anecdotes from his younger days in the village and how he would perform stunts on bicycle to impress girls. He also recalled the time he ate insects in an attempt to learn swimming and changed both his and his fatherâ€™s surname to Tripathi from Tivari.
Speaking about performing bicycle stunts, the actor said, â€œI used to perform stunts on the bicycle because there was a boy who would perform such stunts and he was very popular among girls. I am talking about the time I was in 7th or 8th standard in school. In school at the time, a slow cycle race was organised, so that boy, who was the winner of that race, became very popular among girls. So, I learned the same thing hoping that I would be the winner next year, but I lost, I wasnâ€™t the winner.â€

"Salaar Part 1: Ceasefire has become one of the highest-grossing South Indian films of all time. But after 18 days of release, the film is gradually being phased out of cinema halls. Directed by Prashanth Neel, Salaar witnessed a sharp decline in its box office collections in its third week.

"Captain Millerâ€™s trailer assured that the film, like Arun Matheshwaranâ€™s earlier movies and like every other star vehicle these days, will be a blood bath. The trailerâ€™s background score, like in the trailers of Kamal Haasanâ€™s Viswaproopam and Vikramâ€™s Dhruvanatchathiram, was made of bullet and bomb sounds. The promo teemed with bodies blowing up, heads getting pulverised by bullets and blood splashes. However, the new song from Captain Miller tells there is a calm (before the storm) segment in the film.
Titled â€œKombari Vettapuliâ€, the song, composed by GV Prakash and sung by Dhee, is a folksy number. Of course with Dheeâ€™s rendition, it effortlessly generates a rural flavour. And the stills show Dhanush as this smitten young and working-class guy, who is lost in the beauty of Priya Arul Mohanâ€™s character. She, on the other hand, seems to be a girl of an affluent background. However, what tells more about the film is lyricist Vivekâ€™s lines.

TidalWave Comics has added the 22-page book to its FAME series, which uses the comic medium to shine a light on musical acts.

All able-bodied men in South Korea aged between 18 and 28 must serve in the military for between 18 and 21 months as part of efforts to defend against nuclear-armed North Korea.
Some have won exemptions or served shorter terms, including Olympic medalists and prize-winning classical musicians. Some lawmakers had called for BTS to be exempt.
But in December 2022 the eldest member Jin joined the army, and the others followed, with the final four beginning their duty last month. Fans have pledged to wait until 2025 for them to perform as a group again.

"You canâ€™t get too carried away by either praise or hate, says actor Ananya Panday, who is earning rave reviews for her performance in Kho Gaye Hum Kahan, a film she describes as a relevant story that captures the impact of social media on youth.
Panday, who made her movie debut with 2019â€™s Student of the Year 2, has often been targeted by online trolls for her comments, fashion choices and sometimes, just for hailing from a film family.
The 25-year-old, who is the daughter of actor Chunky Panday, said she has been vocal about people expressing themselves and learning from their mistakes. She believes whatever she has experienced since she became an actor has contributed to her growth.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œIf I hadnâ€™t been exposed to those emotions, I would probably not be able to perform a certain way. So Iâ€™m grateful for whateverâ€™s happened because I have been allowed to express myself through my work. And, some criticism is actually helpful and important feedback. Obviously, you have to block out the mindless trolling,â€ Panday told PTI in an interview.
Asked about the praise that has come her way post Kho Gaye Hum Kahan and 2022â€™s Gehraiyaan, the actor said she has learned to take all feedback in her stride.
â€œI feel like peopleâ€™s perceptions change every Friday. You canâ€™t get too carried away by praise or by hate. You have to keep working hard, thatâ€™s the best you can do. You canâ€™t change the way people speak, so you can only work on yourself. Thatâ€™s what I have learned,â€ added Panday, who also runs a digital social responsibility initiative against online bullying.
She is happy that people have connected with her character of Ahana, a workaholic marketing executive, who feels stuck in her relationship and career, and takes to social media to seek validation. Panday said the film, also starring Siddhant Chaturvedi and Adarsh Gourav, was one of the â€œbest working experiencesâ€ she has had. Netflixâ€™s Kho Gaye Hum Kahan is directed by Arjun Varain Singh and released on December 26.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œI want to be able to play characters that go beyond generation, that people always remember, people feel happy when they think about and they feel like they can relate to,â€ said the actor, recalling growing up on films such as Jaane Tu Yaa Jaane Naa, Ye Jawani Hai Deewani and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai.
Kho Gaye Hum Kahan captures the pitfalls of hyper-connectivity in the internet era and the constant need for validation from strangers through the story of three friends, who are unable to move forward in life for different reasons whether itâ€™s Pandayâ€™s Ahana, Chaturvediâ€™s Imaad, a stand-up comic hiding a tragedy, or Gouravâ€™s Neil, a fitness instructor trying to make it big.
Through the film, Panday said, they wanted to understand the current generation and depict â€œwhatâ€™s going on around all of usâ€. â€œWe all felt it, all the actors, the directorâ€¦ Everyone felt like this was happening in their lives and people werenâ€™t talking about it. It is such a relevant issue because itâ€™s not just about social media. Itâ€™s about the way relationships have changed.â€
Ananya Panday, who is an active Instagram user but is â€œtoo scaredâ€ of X, said the film helped her relook at her own relationship with social media. â€œAt the end of the day, everyone has to realise that it is just for fun and it can be all taken away with just a click of a button. You just shut your phone and itâ€™s all gone. And, thereâ€™s a real world out there with actual people and connections to form.â€

Panday has received acclaim for some of the emotional scenes in the movie, but the actor said those came easy to her as opposed to fun moments in the film.
â€œStrangely, for me, the toughest part as an actor is to laugh on screen. And, this is one of those films where there were moments where the friends are hanging out and we had to laugh and I just couldnâ€™t do it,â€ the actor recalled.
What helped her was a workshop with acting coach Atul Mongia. â€œHe does this exercise where he does â€˜every degree of an emotionâ€™, where you have to go from zero to hundred. I could do anger, sadness, everything, but I just couldnâ€™t do happiness and laughter. He made me sit in the middle of a room. First, he made me cry and then, he made me laugh,â€ she said.
Ananya Pandayâ€™s upcoming projects include Vikramaditya Motwaneâ€™s film Control and her debut web series Call Me Bae, a fun chick-flick, and an untitled film.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œAs an actor, itâ€™s gratifying that directors like Zoya (Akhtar â€“ co-writer of â€˜Kho Gayeâ€¦â€™), Shakun (Batra â€“ â€˜Gehraiyaanâ€™), and Vikram sirâ€¦ They see something in me and want to work with me. To me, thatâ€™s the best reward as an actor to work with people where I can learn something and grow,â€ she said.

"Bollywood actor Katrina Kaif is currently gearing up for the release of her upcoming film Merry Christmas opposite Vijay Sethupathi. While fans are thrilled about this new pairing, Katrina, Vijay, and filmmaker Sriram Raghavan sat down to answer a few fan questions. Katrina was asked about her â€˜calm and composedâ€™ demeanour and how she stays calm most of the time. The Tiger actor immediately credited her husband-actor Vicky Kaus0hal for her calm nature and also explained the reason behind it.
In a chat with Pinkvilla, Katrina was asked by a fan, â€œHow do you maintain your demeanor and calmness every time?â€ The actor replied, â€œYou just need to ask this question to Vicky. So I go home, and I will speak for 45 minutes if Iâ€™m worked up about something in an incredible rant.

Then we forget about it, and thatâ€™s how I can come here and be calm.â€

On the Digital Commentary podcast, Khan was asked about his thoughts on receiving significantly lower pay than Akshay in the film Welcome. The actor said, â€œMy payment might have been lesser than Akshay Kumarâ€™s staff in the film. Unfortunately our films spend a lot of money on â€˜starsâ€™. We go everywhere on our own, we travel in economy and stay in the hotels provided by the makers. In Dubai, the hotel I was allotted, was the same hotel in which Akshayâ€™s staff was staying. This happens a lot in big films.â€

"Success meet has become a post-release promotional event. And while makers go all out to celebrate the alleged success of their movies, Hombale Films has chosen to keep things simple with a small party for the success of Salaar Part 1: Ceasefire with the distributors in attendance, or it could be the start of a series of celebrations. Hombale founders Vijay Vijay Kiragandur and Chaluve Gowda, director Prashanth Neel, Prabhas, and Prithviraj were in attendance and the pictures from the party have gone viral on social media.
In once of the photos, Prabhas and Prithviraj can be seen cutting the cake. Like the film, the theme of the event also seems to have been black as most of the attendees were clad in it. Hombale Pictures shared the pictures from the event on X. â€œThe blockbuster success calls for a BLOCKBUSTER CELEBRATION!â€ read the caption.

"Yet another dance floor, yet another domination. Actors Arjun Kapoor and Ranveer Singh set the dance floor on fire as they matched steps to groove on their chartbusters.
In a video that has surfaced on social media, the duo is seen in a dance-off. The clip begins with Arjun and Ranveer (with his back to the camera) doing the hook step of the catchy Khalibali song from Padmaavat. Ranveer and Arjun are then seen dancing wildly to the Bajirao Mastani banger Malhari. Again, the duo is filmed doing the energetic hook step as guests in the background also groove with them.

"They may not have had lukewarm chardonnay on the tables, as nominee Jennifer Lawrence had predicted. But the 81st Golden Globes had a bit of everything else: Some silliness, some seriousness, a bit of history, a few good jokes and many bad ones, loads of stars â€” and one Taylor Swift, who didnâ€™t ascend the podium but still made her presence known as perhaps only Swift can.
One decisive trend emerged: In the great Barbenheimer showdown of awards season 2024, round one went to the â€œheimerâ€ part. Christopher Nolanâ€™s sweeping biopic Oppenheimer dominated the evening, among its wins the prizes for best drama, best director for Nolan, and best actor (Cillian Murphy ) and supporting actor (Robert Downey Jr). Greta Gerwigâ€™s candy-coloured Barbie, meanwhile, lost to upset victor Poor Things in the comedy/musical category, but won the new cinematic and box office achievement award, as well as best song for Billie Eilishâ€™s wistful â€œWhat Was I Made For.â€
ICYMI | Golden Globes 2024: Christopher Nolan remembers â€˜dear friendâ€™ Heath Ledger in acceptance speech
It would be unwise to count Barbie out, but it was a disappointing night for her fans, and also for another fearsome force: Swifties. The pop superstar, who spent 2023 smashing all records in sight, lost out on her fifth Globe nomination. But she stunned on the carpet in shimmering Gucci green and later created a meme-worthy moment when she reacted with a seemingly icy glare to a joke about her by host Jo Koy.

Swift was not alone in her displeasure; at one point the jokes were falling flat enough for Koy to stop and explain that heâ€™d had only 10 days to prepare.

The crowd laughed harder at Will Ferrell and Kristen Wiig, who made an amusing bit of pretending â€” insisting â€” that the ceremony was â€œa serious night.â€ The joke was that few actually take the ceremony seriously. Noted presenter Mark Hamill: â€œItâ€™s the only awards show with an open bar.â€
But it was indeed a serious note that served as an emotional highpoint: Lily Gladstone, of Killers of the Flower Moon, became the first Indigenous winner of best actress in a drama, speaking in the Blackfeet language and reminding the crowd that there are still significant advances to be celebrated. Some notable moments of the evening:

A bumpy Start
Koy got a few laughs with a joke about the lengthy Oppenheimer, saying, â€œI needed another hour.â€ But as the monologue went on, it was clear that the comic needed something else: sharper jokes from the writers. Cameras caught negative reactions from celebs like Harrison Ford and Selena Gomez, and the Barbie team did not appear amused when he noted that Oppenheimer was based on serious material but their own film was based on â€œa plastic doll with big boobies.â€
Koy sought to defend himself. â€œYo, I got the gig 10 days ago. You want a perfect monologue?â€ He added: â€œI wrote some of these, and theyâ€™re the ones youâ€™re laughing at.â€

Theyâ€™re not called thatâ€¦
When Daâ€™Vine Joy Randolph won for her acclaimed supporting actress performance in The Holdovers, she duly thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Only problem: The HFPA is now defunct, and many in the audience responded audibly: â€œTheyâ€™re not called that.â€ After several years of turmoil that followed the revelation that the HFPA had no Black members, the Golden Globes were acquired last year by Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions and turned into a for-profit venture. Some 300 entertainment journalists now vote for the awards. Later, Randolph spoke about the vibe of the evening. â€œItâ€™s a party in there,â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s a good time. We got through the pandemic. We stuck through our two strikes. Thereâ€™s a sense of buzz in there.â€
â€¦And he wasnâ€™t called that
Winning an early award for best supporting actor, Downey Jr told the crowd he had taken a beta-blocker, so â€œthis is going to be a breeze.â€ He then misspoke the name of his character, government official Lewis Strauss. â€œDozens of folks have come up to me since the summertime saying that I was, I quote, â€˜unrecognisably subtle as Leonard Strauss,â€™â€ the actor said. â€œTo my fellow nominees, letâ€™s not pretend this is a compliment.â€

â€˜Successionâ€™ succeeds successfully
To nobodyâ€™s surprise, Succession, the HBO drama about the Roy family dynasty, had lots of success, winning best drama as well as major acting awards for Kieran Culkin, Matthew Macfadyen and Sarah Snook. Macfadyen said heâ€™d enjoyed every second of playing the â€œweird and wonderful human grease stainâ€ that was Tom Wambsgans. Culkin, who played troubled son Roman Roy, told the crowd how heâ€™d been nominated for a Golden Globe 20 years ago and never thought heâ€™d be back, and playfully taunted his co-nominee, Pedro Pascal of The Last of Us, quipping: â€œSuck it, Pedro. Mine!â€ And Snook, who played Shiv Roy, ascended the stage and said: â€œOh, wow. I was kind of hoping I didnâ€™t have to get up. Kieranâ€™s usually better at these speeches, right? Donâ€™t you want to get up instead?â€

Also on the TV side, Huluâ€™s kitchen-based The Bear won big â€“ taking best comedy series. Jeremy Allen White won for the second time, and Ayo Edebiri won her first Globe for her own lead performance, charming the ballroom crowd when she thanked the assistants of her agents and managers. â€œTo the people who answer my emails, youâ€™re the real ones,â€ she said, She added: â€œIf I forgot to thank you, Iâ€™m sorry. Unless you were mean or something. Okay, bye!â€

If looks could kill
When Barbie won the new award for cinematic and box office achievement, it beat out the nominee many thought would win: â€œTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour.â€ Still, Swift, whose attendance was in question until her boyfriend, Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs, was ruled inactive for the dayâ€™s game against the Los Angeles Chargers, was a glamorous addition to the evening (Bruce Springsteen was there, too) in her custom Gucci gown. The camera cut to her several times, but she was not happy when Koy joked that the difference between the Globes and the NFL was that the NFL had more reaction shots of Swift. She stared ahead and took a sip of her drink.

The importance of words
It wasnâ€™t far from anyoneâ€™s minds that Hollywood is emerging from historic actors and writers strikes, and one of the more clever presenter bits highlighted the importance of screenwriters. Daniel Kaluuya, Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld joked that theyâ€™d asked for their segment to be written not by writers but by studio executives. â€œWhat is up, Shameik,â€ Kaluuya said, robotically. â€œNot much, Daniel. How are you, Hailee?â€ Moore said. â€œI am relatable,â€ Steinfeld said. The screenplay award they presented had a surprise winner: Justine Triet, writer-director of Anatomy of a Fall, beating out both Barbie and Oppenheimer.

A historic win
The eveningâ€™s emotional highpoint came with the penultimate award, when Gladstone won best actress in a drama for Martin Scorseseâ€™s epic Killers of the Flower Moon, becoming the first Indigenous winner in the category. She opened her speech in the Blackfeet language, explaining backstage that â€œit was one of the more natural things I could do in the moment.â€ In her speech, Gladstone, who played Osage community member Mollie Burkhart, pronounced her win historic and said: â€œThis is for every little rez kid, every little urban kid, every little Native kid out there who has a dream, who is seeing themselves represented and our stories told â€” by ourselves, in our own words â€” with tremendous allies and tremendous trust from and with each other.â€

"As India and the Maldives face increasing tensions over a controversial tweet by a Maldivian minister, Bollywood celebrities are using social media to stand in solidarity with the archipelago. 
Actors like Salman Khan, Kangana Ranaut, Akshay Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan and Shraddha Kapoor among others are encouraging people to explore the beauty of the islands. Ranveer Singh joined actors promoting domestic tourism, backing Lakshadweep. However, he mistakenly shared a 2016 picture of the Maldives instead of Lakshadweep in his tweet. Fans noticed the error, and the actor deleted the tweet and posted a note without pictures after some hours.

During a press meet, Sethupathi was asked about doing a Hindi film while the politics of Tamil Nadu is against the imposition of the language. The 96 actor lost his cool and asked what was the point of the question.
The actor was asked, â€œTamil Nadu politics, for the past 75 years has been against Hindi-imposition. Even now, we are wearing â€˜Hindi Theriyadhu Poda (Donâ€™t Know Hindi Poda)â€™ t-shirtsâ€¦â€ Before the reporter could finish the question, Sethupathi interrupted, â€œYou asked the same question when Aamir Khan Sir was here.

"One of the most anticipated Kannada films of the year, Upendraâ€™s upcoming feature UI has been generating buzz since its initial announcement. The excitement surrounding the movie has only intensified since Kannada star Kiccha Sudeep unveiled the movieâ€™s first look on Monday during a grand ceremony in Bengaluru. In the presence of veteran producer Allu Arvind and superstar Shivarajkumar, Sudeep released a 116-second teaser of UI, providing a glimpse into its surreal world.
Though the teaser doesnâ€™t reveal many details about the film, it begins with a disclaimer stating, â€œThis is not the AI world. This is the UI world,â€ accompanied by surreal visuals of a land bathed in purple. The camera then soars above a landscape, offering a birdâ€™s-eye view of the area adjacent to hillocks, a water body and various buildings.

"Renowned filmmaker Christopher Nolan bagged the Best Director-Motion Picture award for his biopic film Oppenheimer. According to Variety, a US-based media outlet, the award marks Nolanâ€™s first Globe, having been previously nominated for writing 2000â€™s Memento, writing and directing 2010â€™s Inception and directing 2017â€™s Dunkirk.
In this yearâ€™s director race, Nolan was up against Bradley Cooper for Maestro, Greta Gerwig for Barbie, Yorgos Lanthimos for Poor Things, Martin Scorsese for Killers of the Flower Moon and Celine Song for Past Lives.

During his acceptance speech at the award ceremony, Nolan remembered his â€œdear friendâ€ Heath Ledger, who portrayed the negative role in his film The Dark Knight.

â€œThe only time Iâ€™ve ever been on this stage before was accepting one of these on behalf of our dear friend, Heath Ledger, and that was complicated and challenging for me,â€ Nolan said. â€œIn the middle of speaking, I got all stuck, and Robert Downey Jr. caught my eye and gave me a look of love and support â€” the same look heâ€™s giving me now.â€
Heath Ledger died at the age of 28 of an accidental overdose after filming of The Dark Knight was complete but before the movie was released. His haunting portrayal of the Joker earned him numerous posthumous awards, including the Golden Globe and Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, as per Variety.

â€œI thought it would be simpler accepting for myself. But, as a director, I realise I can only accept this on behalf of people. As directors, we bring people together and we try to get them to give their best,â€ he added.
The biopic, set during World War II, follows Oppenheimer, known as the â€œFather of the Atomic Bomb,â€ during a period in history when he understood that testing the atomic bomb would ignite the atmosphere and destroy the world, yet he pushed the button anyway.

Gladstone and DiCaprio walked the red carpet with their respective mothers. After her win backstage, she paid homage to her parents for supporting her dreams. The actor said her father watched from home, where they would have a â€œbig olâ€™ feast.â€
â€œEvery time Iâ€™ve felt a level of guilt or it wasnâ€™t really possible, my mom and my dad my whole life never once questioned that this is what I was meant to do,â€ said Gladstone, who is an only child. â€œThey would always support me when it was the times of famine and the times of feast.â€ Itâ€™s â€œa beautiful community, nation, that encouraged me to keep going, keep doing this,â€ Gladstone said of the Blackfeet Nation.
â€œIâ€™m here with my mom, who, even though sheâ€™s not Blackfeet, worked tirelessly to get our language into our classrooms so I had a Blackfeet-language teacher growing up.â€
The actor, who grew up between Seattle and the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana, was named one of 2023â€™s AP Breakthrough Entertainers. Gladstone said she typically greets people in her Blackfeet language.

â€œItâ€™s often how I introduce myself in a new group of people, especially when itâ€™s significant,â€ she said. â€œIt was one of the more natural things I could do in the moment.â€
On the subject of a possible Oscar win, Gladstone told The Associated Press: â€œIt would be an incredible moment in my life, but it would mean so much more than just me.â€ â€œIt is, of course, something I have to think about, insofar as I would just really love to speak some of my language â€” and teach myself a little bit more of my language â€” to have and to hold in that moment,â€ she continued.
Gladstone is the second Native actress to receive a nomination at the Globes after Irene Bedard, who received a nod for the 1995 television movie â€œLakota Woman: Siege at Wounded Knee.â€
â€œI donâ€™t have words,â€ Gladstone said. â€œIâ€™m so grateful that I can speak even a little bit of my language, which Iâ€™m not fluent in, up here, because in this business, Native actors used to speak their lines in English, and then the sound mixers would run them backwards to accomplish Native languages on camera.â€

Speaking of the award, Gladstone said: â€œIt doesnâ€™t belong to just me. Iâ€™m holding it right now. Iâ€™m holding it with all my beautiful sisters in the film.â€

â€œI really need to thank the father of my children and my best friend, Justin for all of your love and support,â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s because of you that Iâ€™m able to be a working mother.â€ The win makes Wong, whose parents are Chinese and Vietnamese, the first nominee and now winner of Asian descent in the category, which began in 1982.
Darren Criss was the first actor of Asian descent, male or female, to win a limited series lead with 2018â€™s The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, while Yoko Shimadaâ€™s win for best actress in a drama series (for Shogun) at the 1981 Golden Globes made her the first Asian actress to win in television, reported The Hollywood Reporter."
"After Javed Akhtar, Kangana Ranaut has spoken against Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s film Animal. In a tweet, the actor put the responsibility on the audience for flocking to theatres to watch a â€˜women beating films.â€™ The actor also called this trend â€˜discouragingâ€™ and hinted at a possible career shift in the coming years.
Kangana reposted a fanâ€™s tweet, which mentioned that her last film Tejas is an â€˜excellent movie.â€™ The fan said she â€˜fails to understand why it didnâ€™t do well,â€™ mentioning how â€˜Karan Johar and gang are waiting to destroy her.â€™ Kangana shared this tweet and claimed that her films are subjected to â€˜paid negativity. She also bashed Ranbir Kapoor-starrer Animal and wrote, â€œPaid negativity for my films is overwhelming, I have been fighting hard so far but even audiences are encouraging women beating films where they are treated like sex objects and asked to lick shoes.â€

"Raj Kapoorâ€™s era defining film, Mera Naam Joker, could have featured Mumtaz in the role of the trapeze artist. The actor, however, missed out on the opportunity due to her romantic involvement with Raj Kapoorâ€™s brother, Shammi Kapoor. Mumtaz recently disclosed the reason behind Raj Kapoorâ€™s decision in an interview with the Pakistani newspaper Dawn.
According to Mumtaz, Raj Kapoor, lead actor and director of Mera Naam Joker, had her audition for the role, but later decided against casting her. She said, â€œRaj ji had me audition for Mera Naam Joker but he later cut me saying that, â€˜You will come to our house and we donâ€™t want you to wear such small clothes in the film.â€™ So he decided not to cast me in the film.â€ Mumtaz was supposed to play the character of the trapeze artist named Marina in the film. The character was later enacted by a Russian actor, Kseniya Ryabinkina.

In its third weekend, the film witnessed a slight jump, with an expected collection of Rs 4.25 crore on Sunday, bringing the filmâ€™s domestic total to Rs 216.57 crore, according to industry tracker Sacnilk.

"Actor Ranbir Kapoor says some people may have had issues with Animal, but the box office success that his latest release has received proves love for a film conquers everything.
Animal, a crime action drama, emerged as one of the highest grossing Hindi movies of 2023 despite being labelled as misogynistic and brutally violent by a section of viewers and critics.
Indian Express Entertainment is now on WhatsApp Channels. Follow us for the latest news, interviews, reviews, photos and more.
ADVERTISEMENT
Directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, the film released on December 1. It earned over Rs 900 crore worldwide.
Speaking at the success party of Animal on Saturday night, Ranbir Kapoor expressed gratitude to the director for making him part of his vision.
â€œI want to thank all of you for being here today to celebrate Animal. It is a film that a section of people had an issue with but I feel the kind of love, success and the numbers (it has received) proves that nothing goes beyond the love for a movie. Nothing goes beyond movies,â€ the actor said at the event.
The success bash was attended by Reddy Vanga and Animal actors Anil Kapoor, Bobby Deol, Rashmika Mandanna, Triptii Dimri, Prem Chopra, Suresh Oberoi, Saurabh Sachdeva, and Siddhant Karnick.

The director thanked the cast and crew of â€œAnimalâ€ for contributing towards the success of the film, set against the backdrop of a troubled father-son relationship.
â€œEvery character was very special and striking in the film and it happened because of everybodyâ€™s hard work. Thank you to the producer, lyricist, musicians, and thank you everyone,â€ said Reddy Vanga, who courted controversy for his previous films Arjun Reddy and Kabir Singh.
Deol, whose turn as the menacing mute gangster Abrar Haque became one of the highlights of Animal, credited Reddy Vanga for the filmâ€™s success.
â€œIt is all so amazing. All this couldnâ€™t have happened without Sandeep Reddy Vanga. He had this vision to create this film with conviction,â€ he said.

Dimri, who essayed the role of Rannvijayâ€™s mistress Zoya in the film, echoed Deolâ€™s sentiments.
â€œI want to thank Sandeep sir from my heart for giving me this opportunity and believing in me,â€ she said.
Anil Kapoor called leading lady Mandanna as the filmâ€™s â€œlucky mascotâ€.
â€œFilm is a directorâ€™s medium. It was Sandeepâ€™s vision. Rashmika is the lucky mascot. Pushpa and now Animal, always lucky. I told you Bobby that this will change your life,â€ he added.

"Actor Kangana Ranaut is known for not mincing her words. Time and again, she has expressed strong opinions on Bollywood and its ways. However, on Sunday, she wrote about the equation between a star and their fans. She wrote about how fascinated fans get when they notice their favourite star in public and think of it as a â€œmiracleâ€.
Taking to Instagram, Kangana wrote, â€œThe best thing about being an actor is whenever people see you at the airport, in the lounge, in the aircraft, or even in a shop, restaurant, simply strolling around in the streets, their face lights up with a big unexpected smile as if a small miracle has happened. As if a good omen has been bestowed upon them as if the glamorous world of celluloid has collided with their mundane life leaving a haze of stardust.â€

"The Golden Globes are back from the dead, and ready to party. The long-running award show will again have the champagne flowing Sunday night when the 81st Globes begin at 8 p.m. EST. Much will look the same as always when well-attired celebrities gather at the Beverly Hilton International Ballroom in Los Angeles.
But the Globes are returning sans the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which was disbanded after years of diversity and ethical scandals. The Globes also lost its longtime network home. This yearâ€™s show is being broadcast on CBS in a one-year deal. Can the revamped Globes recapture the bubbly, irreverent spirit of all those shows hosted by Ricky Gervais or Tina Fey and Amy Poehler? Those broadcasts help turn the Globes into the third biggest award show of the year, after the Oscars and the Grammys.
The Globesâ€™ glitzy good time enabled many to overlook the impropriates of an award show that often doubled as a punchline. Regardless of the behind-the-scenes drama, most viewers tune in for the dresses, the speeches and the stars â€” of which there is a bountiful array this year. Among the expected attendees is Taylor Swift, whose â€œTaylor Swift: The Eras Tourâ€ is nominated for the newly launched â€œcinematic and box-office achievementâ€ award. Swiftâ€™s boyfriend, Travis Kelce, will be playing with the Kansas City Chiefs at nearby SoFi Stadium earlier in the day.

Swift, along with the stars of likely winners Oppenheimerâ€ and â€œBarbie,â€ are some of the main attractions in Sundayâ€™s ceremony, hosted by Jo Koy. The comedian, who isnâ€™t expected to strike as caustic a tone as previous hosts, will be tasked with leading the Globes into a new era. Even the menu ( Nobu is catering ) has been flipped.
HOW TO WATCH
CBS will air the ceremony live after an afternoon of NFL broadcasts. The show will also be streamed live via the Showtime plan on Paramount+. The Globes can also be watched through live TV streaming services that include CBS in their lineup, like Hulu + Live TV, YouTube TV and FuboTV. Red carpet coverage will be online. The official pre-show will be hosted by â€œEntertainment Tonightâ€ and Variety beginning 6:30 Eastern. The red carpet will stream on the Golden Globes site, ETOnline.com, Varietyâ€™s website and social platforms and other Penske Media publications.
WHATâ€™S IN STORE FOR THE SHOW
Announced presenters include Oprah Winfrey, Will Ferrell, Ben Affleck, America Ferrara, Michelle Yeoh, Issa Rae, Florence Pugh, Angela Bassett and Amanda Seyfriend.
You wonâ€™t see two awards usually handed out at the Globes: the Cecil B. DeMille Award or the Carol Burnett Award. Both of those tribute honours arenâ€™t being given this year, though two new categories are: the blockbuster award and one for a stand-up comedy special.
THE CONTENDERS
ADVERTISEMENT
Greta Gerwigâ€™s Barbie, the biggest movie of the year with more than $1.4 billion in ticket sales, comes in the lead-nominee with nine nods, including Best Comedy or musical, Best Director for Gerwig, Best Actress for Margot Robbie, Best Supporting Actor for Ryan Gosling, and three original song nominations.
Christopher Nolanâ€™s Oppenheimer is close behind with eight nominations, including for Best Drama, Best Director for Nolan, Best Actor for Cillian Murphy and supporting nods for Robert Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt.
Barbie and Oppenheimer are expected to clean up, but look for possible wins from front-runners including Lily Gladstone for Killers of the Flower Moon, Emma Stone for Poor Things and Daâ€™Vine Joy Randolph for â€œThe Holdovers.
On the TV side, HBOâ€™s Succession leads with nine nominations. The Bear and â€œOnly Murders in the Buildingâ€ follow with five apiece.
THE GLOBES COMEBACK
ADVERTISEMENT
A few years ago, the Golden Globes were on the cusp of collapse. After The Los Angeles Times reported that the HFPA had no Black members, Hollywood boycotted the organization. The 2022 Globes were all but cancelled and taken off TV. After reforms, the Globes returned to NBC last year in a one-year deal, but the show was booted to Tuesday evening. With Jerrod Carmichael hosting, the telecast attracted 6.3 million viewers, a new low on NBC and a far cry from the 20 million that once tuned in.
The Golden Globes were acquired by Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions, which Penske Media owns, and turned into a for-profit venture. The HFPA (which typically numbered around 90 voters) was dissolved and a new group of some 300 entertainment journalists from around the world now vote for the awards.

Questions remain about the Globesâ€™ long-term future, but their value to Hollywood studios remains providing a marketing boost to awards contenders. (The Oscars wonâ€™t be held until March 10.) This year, because of the actors and writers strikes, the Globes are airing ahead of the Emmys, which were postponed to Jan. 15.
With movie ticket sales still 20% off the pre-pandemic pace and the industry facing a potentially rocky 2024 at the box office, Hollywood needs the Golden Globes as much as it ever has.

"Renowned for his diverse roles in Hindi cinema, Pankaj Tripathi gained widespread recognition with his portrayal of gangster Sultan Qureshi in Anurag Kashyapâ€™s iconic film Gangs of Wasseypur. Despite the relatively smaller screen time, Tripathiâ€™s impactful performance resonated with audiences and even garnered attention from real-life gangsters who saw Sultan aka Tripathi as an idol.
During an interview with India TV, Tripathi was asked if the rumour of gangsters approaching him after he played the character of Sultan in Gangs of Wasseypur is true. Admitting the same, the actor said in Hindi, â€œMany gangsters approached me. At that time, many gangsters in North and South India started thinking of me as their idol. They thought Sultan does what he speaks in the film, and he also has a good character in the film. So, they started liking Sultan a lot. Many writers after that, who would come to narrate stories to me, would be scared that I would take out a knife from my pocket.â€

"Filmmaker Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Animal has finally slowed down at the box office, but the seeming vitriol on Twitter is still powering through. The official page of Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s Animal has now lashed out at veteran writer Javed Akhtar, days after he indirectly criticised the blockbuster.
Animal, which was released on December 1, met with polarising reviews, sharply dividing the audience. While a section of the audience found the action thriller audacious, others called it out for peddling toxic masculinity and being a highly problematic film.

"The legendary Javed Akhtar has never hesitated to speak his heart. Recently, he was at an event organized by ABP Majha where he spoke about several things related to art and cinema. He shared how filmmaking has become difficult these days.
Javed Akhtar said, â€œFilm is an expensive exercise, it needs a big capital. And capital comes with an agenda, it wants the larger interest to be protected. Today the truth is that making a film has become difficult than before. People who bag the film get scared, and the censor gets scared. The fear of making a good or realistic film has increased.â€

"What would Shah Rukh Khan do if he reads an article that he feels is defamatory? In the 90s, at least, he would march into the publicationâ€™s office and break it. The revelation comes from an old interview with his entrepreneur wife Gauri Khan, who spoke candidly about the impact speculative pieces would have on her superstar husband.
Users on Reddit posted a 1994 Filmfare interview of Gauri, which had the headline, â€˜The Pleasure of his company.â€™ During the interview, which took place two years after she shifted to Mumbai, Gauri was asked if she feels â€œembarrassedâ€ how Shah Rukh has been open about his love for her.

"Javed Akhtar delved into the evolving concept of the modern woman in Hindi cinema in a recent interview. Reflecting on the historical depiction of women as submissive and quiet, Akhtar acknowledged the industryâ€™s shift towards questioning these stereotypes. Despite this evolution, Akhtar expressed the ongoing struggle to define the modern woman. The screenwriter took examples of iconic actors Sridevi and Madhuri Dixit and how they never got big roles in their careers. He also bashed Yash Chopraâ€™s film, Jab Tak Hai Jaan, for its â€˜ridiculousâ€™ idea of an empowered woman.
Speaking about it on ABP Majha, Akhtar said, â€œWho is the new woman? We are not clear about it. There are two reasons for it. Those who are liberal, if they define this as a modern woman, other liberals will question them. Those who are conservative, if they define it, they feel that they will lose a lot of their territory. So, they donâ€™t want to do it. There were so many talented women -Sridevi and Madhuri Dixit â€“ they werenâ€™t any less talented than any of the actors, but they didnâ€™t get a big role in their whole career. For instance, they didnâ€™t get roles like Mother India, Bandini and Sujata. It is because people donâ€™t know what is an ideal woman.â€

"Manoj Bajpayee maintains a healthy lifestyle, and has not had dinner in 14 years. In a recent interview, the actor was asked if he follows a special diet, and if he is also working on his abs. The actor revealed the reason why he gave up dinners, and said that he places a lot of importance on exercise as well.
He shared with Jist, â€œFood is the biggest enemy when it comes to weight and illnesses. When you stop eating dinner, there are many illnesses that you save yourself from. I reduced my intake of food because I like food. You will wonder why? Because the lunch that I have, thatâ€™s great. I have rice, roti and my favourite vegetarian or non-vegetarian dish with it.â€

"Prabhas-starrer Salaar made an impressive debut at the box office, raking in Rs 90.7 crore on its opening day and surpassing Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Jawan which had been the biggest opener of 2023. However, despite the record-breaking start, the film has experienced a consistent decline in its collections. Although there was a surge during the New Year holiday, the filmâ€™s performance tapered off once the holiday season concluded.
According to industry tracker Sacnilk, Salaar is anticipated to earn Rs 5.25 crore on its third Saturday, bringing its total domestic collection to Rs 387 crore. To put Salaarâ€™s performance into perspective, on their respective third Saturdays, Jawan earned Rs 14 crore, Animal, starring Ranbir Kapoor, secured Rs 12.8 crore, Gadar 2, featuring Sunny Deol, made Rs 13.75 crore, and Rajinikanthâ€™s Jailer garnered Rs 7.3 crore. Salaar amassed a total of Rs 308 crore in its first week. The film, however, saw a 77 per cent decline in its collection and raked in Rs 70.1 crore in its second week.

"Late actor Irrfan Khan started working in the entertainment industry from the early days of television in India and before he could make his way into films, in India and abroad, the late actor was working in a few TV shows and trying to make a mark. In Shubhra Guptaâ€™s book, Irrfan: A Life in Movies, his wife Sutapa Sikdar spoke about this phase of his life and recalled that while Irrfan was doing some great work in a few episodes of Bestsellers, he had had a few boring experiences on other television shows, like Chandrakanta. At one point, Irrfan even left Chandrakanta but was called back by the makers because the audience loved his style of acting.
Sutapa, in the book recalled, that she was turning into a producer for television and was in the process of putting a show together for Star. But her producing dreams came to a standstill as Ekta Kapoorâ€™s Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi happened and changed TV forever. This affected Irrfanâ€™s career in a way that he never even imagined. â€œI must thank Ekta Kapoor for one thing. We were doing one show for Star, which was a proper TV show. We were the producers â€“ we wrote it and went to Delhi as new producers who will be doing this revolutionary, pathbreaking show. We shot four episodes and then Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi came,â€ she shared.

"Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s latest film Animal became a box office hit, but it also turned out to be the most controversial film of the year. Since its release, the film has faced criticism for its portrayal of alpha males and toxic masculinity. Javed Akhtar, speaking at the Ajanta-Ellora International Film Festival (AIFF), expressed concern about the filmâ€™s success, citing it as dangerous. However, he also pointed to the popularity of the song â€˜Choli Ke Peeche Kya Haiâ€™, which was a part of the 1993 film Khalnayak, and urged the audience to choose content wisely.
He said, â€œLog mujhe bolne lage hai ki â€˜Saab aaj-kal kaise gaane hone lage haiâ€™. Gaane toh 6-7 aadmi mil ke banate hai. Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai, ek aadmi ne likha, do aadmi ne compose kiya, 2 ladkiyon ne dance kiya, ek cameraman ne shoot kiya. Yeh 8-10 log thodi problem hai. Problem yeh hai ki yeh gaana samaj mein superhit ho gaya tha. Yeh crore logon ko aacha laga tha. Yeh hume darr lagta hai. (People started telling me, â€˜Sir, what kind of songs are being made these days?â€™  Songs are created by 6-7 individuals. For Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai, one person wrote it, two people composed it, two girls danced to it, and one cameraman shot it. These 8-10 people are not a problem. The problem is that this song became a superhit and was liked by crores of people. This scares us.)â€

She said, â€œI had actually first really noticed in the film class of 83â€¦ Is it class of 83 or 83?â€ When Vijay and Sriram both corrected her and reminded her that it was 96, she continued, â€œ96, sorry. Thatâ€™s a few years off butâ€¦ I had actually loved that film 96. It had scenes that even now I remember in my head. The moments between him and Trisha, very unique and very tender, they really stayed with me. So I was familiar with him from that movie.â€

"Manoj Bajpayee has been in the movies for over two decades now, and while the actor has worked with some of the most renowned directors of the Hindi film industry, he has also had major disagreements with many of them. In a recent interview, when Manoj was asked about his extended tiffs with Anurag Kashyap, Tigmanshu Dhulia, Anubhav Sinha, and Hansal Mehta, the actor said that since they are all friends, they tend to fight with each other sometimes. The actor, however, admitted that he had an uncontrollable temper when he lived in Delhi before moving to Mumbai, and would often get in fights in local DTC (Delhi Transport Corporation) buses in the capital.
â€œI used to get really furious in DTC buses. Because whenever I would see that someone was misbehaving with a woman, and if the woman was protesting, then I would really beat that guy up. Most of my fights in Delhi have happened because of this. I have no regrets over that,â€ he shared with Jist. When the interviewer brought up Manojâ€™s fights in Bihar, the actor brushed it aside, claiming that it was teenage angst that compelled him to get into altercations.

"Filmmaker Rohit Shetty is entering the digital space with his web series Indian Police Force which seems like an extension of his cop universe. Even though there are no clear restrictions on the content on streaming platforms, Rohit recently said that he did not want to include any sex scenes or even hint towards anything vulgar in his web series.
In a podcast with Bharti Singh and her husband Haarsh Limbachiyaa, Rohit said that Indian Police Force doesnâ€™t even have many cuss words, barring one or two episodes where it was essential for the characters to speak that way. â€œThere are a few cuss words in a couple of episodes, that too because the characters are cops, thatâ€™s why. Other than that, no sex, no vulgarity. Our Indian culture is different. We still have a lot of respect and we are known for that. Those who are making it are not doing anything wrong but mujhe apni core audience ko uncomfortable nahi karna hai. (I donâ€™t want to make my core audience uncomfortable),â€ he said.

"Despite facing significant criticism for its perceived â€œglorificationâ€ of misogyny and violence, director Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Ranbir Kapoor-starrer Animal emerged as one of the biggest Indian blockbusters of 2023, earning close to Rs 900 crore worldwide.
While many industry insiders have praised the film, there is a substantial number of people who have expressed their disapproval of Vangaâ€™s handling of themes such as feminism and toxic masculinity. Joining the critics, albeit indirectly, is screenwriter, lyricist and poet Javed Akhtar, who, along with Salim Khan, crafted some of the biggest blockbusters in Indian cinemaâ€™s history. Many of their films featured gruff male protagonists, and together, theyâ€™re credited with creating the â€œAngry Young Manâ€ archetype in Bollywood cinema.

"Bigg Boss 17 is heading into its final month, and things are heating up inside the house. Viewers are eagerly awaiting the Weekend ka Vaar episode with host Salman Khan, following an argument between former couple, Isha Malviya and Abhishek Kumar. The matter escalated when Abhishek slapped Ishaâ€™s current partner, Samarth Jurel. On the latest episode, Abhishek discussed his breakup with Isha, pointing fingers at her mother for playing a big role in their separation.
Abhishek discussed this with Munawar Faruqui, when he spotted Isha and Samarth together. He said, â€œOnce they step out, if Isha sees that they are equal, then itâ€™s ok. But if she thinks that she is superior to Samarth, she will leave him. Her mom will break them up. I know. Hamare relationship me, hamare break-up pe iske mom ka bahut bada haath hai (Ishaâ€™s mother has a big role in our break up).â€

"Somen Mishra, Head of Content at Dharma Productions, addressed a common concern in the film industry. Sharing a video featuring filmmaker Rohit Shetty acknowledging the writers of his upcoming series, Indian Police Force, Somen took the opportunity on Instagram to express his views on directors who overlook crediting their writers. Citing the example of â€˜a film that was released on OTT recentlyâ€™, Somen refrained from naming the director in question. However, Reddit users have tried to join the dots, and decipher the subject of Somenâ€™s comments. 
He wrote, â€œBe like Rohit Shetty. Be like my boss KJ. Always acknowledge your writers. Stop hogging all credits. Some directors have a terrible habit of forgetting their writers. Donâ€™t be a d**k. A film which released on ott recently and is getting lot of love, nobody knows who has written it or the book on which it is based. Because the director remembers only him doing everything in all his interviews.â€

"Filmmaker Sriram Raghavanâ€™s upcoming film, Merry Christmas, stars the unlikely pair Katrina Kaif and Vijay Sethupathi. However, the filmmaker had earlier considered Saif Ali Khan for the lead role, but while working on the script, he discovered that Saif wouldnâ€™t be right for the part. The filmmaker clarified his earlier comments about the subject, which he said were misconstrued to suggest that heâ€™d rejected Saif for the role.
During an interview with Bollywood Hungama, Sriram said, â€œActually, I had this story for about three years. I met Katrina and she said lets do something. Then, after Andhadhun, I decided to go ahead with it. Initially, when I was looking at it, I was looking at a Hindi film, no Tamil version and all. I was thinking of Saif because I have worked with him in a couple of movies earlier. So, I thought it might be interesting. I met him and he liked the subject, he liked it very much.â€

"Actors Manoj Bajpayee and Shah Rukh Khan can trace their origins to the same acting group in Delhi, but the two chose very different styles of cinema as their careers progressed. While Shah Rukh emerged as one of the biggest stars in Indian cinema history, Manoj made parallel cinema and off-beat characters his strength. He said that their worlds are so different now that the two of them donâ€™t even bump into each other anymore.
Manoj has earlier narrated an incident from their Delhi days, when he and Shah Rukh went to a club together but the Gangs of Wasseypur actor was denied entry because he wasnâ€™t wearing the proper footwear. Manoj described that as a â€˜one-off incidentâ€™ as he downplayed their closeness even back in the day.

"When AR Rahman won not just one but two Oscars for the song â€œJai Hoâ€ and the original score of Slumdog Millionaire in 2009, Tamilians were ecstatic. The composer further made the state of Tamil Nadu proud by speaking in his mother tongue on the most prestigious stage. â€œElla Pugazhum Iraivanukae (All praise is for the lord),â€ became the most popular sentence in Tamil and continues to be. However, when the dust settled, everyone wondered if â€œJai Hoâ€ of all other AR Rahmanâ€™s brilliant songs deserved the much-coveted award. Even the ardent fans of Rahman arenâ€™t huge fans of the album. And the surprising fact is that even AR Rahman shares the same doubt. In a felicitation ceremony that was conducted for him in Chennai after he bagged two Oscars, the composer pondered over the same question.
The ceremony was attended by all the Tamil music legends including MS Viswanathan and Ilaiyaraaja, who were two huge inspirations of Rahman. Harris Jeyaraj and other musicians were also present at the event. When Rahman took the stage, he said, â€œRaja Sir said this is because of the blessings of my parents, which is true. I am harvesting the profits of all the work done by my parents. For the past ten years, at every Oscars, I kept seeing either a Japanese composer, or a Chinese composer, or an Italian composer getting awards, and I used to wonder are there no composers here at all? Here we have Raja Sir and MSV Sir and KV Mahadevan Sir, Madhan Mohan, Roshanâ€¦ but they all didnâ€™t need it. Beyond that, they received a lot of love. When Raja Sir stood up, you all made so much noiseâ€¦ that reflected the respect you have for him. This is bigger than Oscar.â€

"Director Sriram Raghavanâ€™s highly-anticipated thriller Merry Christmas, starring Katrina Kaif and Vijay Sethupathi in the lead roles, is all set for release on Friday. Marking the first collaboration between Katrina Kaif and Vijay Sethupathi, the film was shot simultaneously in Hindi and Tamil with distinct supporting casts. Even the trailers for each language were tailored differently, heightening anticipation.
Merry Christmas is Sethupathiâ€™s third Hindi film after Santosh Sivanâ€™s Mumbaikar and Atlee Kumarâ€™s Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Jawan, and the film is exciting his fans across language barriers. At a recent interaction, the actor downplayed his â€˜simplicityâ€™ and said that he wants to abolish this tag altogether.

"Actor Manoj Bajpayee recently expressed his displeasure at audiences for not turning up in large numbers to watch his 2023 film Joram in theatres. He said that while people spend thousands of rupees on mainstream entertainers, they donâ€™t watch â€œreal cinemaâ€. This trend, he said in a new interview, is endangering the art form itself.
In an interview with Jist, while discussing Joramâ€™s box office performance, he said while gesturing at the audience, â€œInmein se kisi ne nahi dekhi hogi (no one here must have watched the film). I am telling you, yeh yetharth hai (it is a possibility). We had purposely released Joram in very few theatres because we wanted to gauge if the audiencesâ€™ brains work the same way as we think, or if they only want to watch other kind of films. People who went to watch the film really liked it, they themselves are promoting it by word or mouth, telling ten other people to watch it. But the majority of the people donâ€™t believe in such films, and even if they do, they want to watch them for free. The same people will take a loan to watch other kinds of films, they are okay doing that, itâ€™s their taste. Our fight is about this. We want to see how interested they are in watching the kind of films we want to make.â€

"Days after â€œQueenâ€ Zeenat Aman shared memories about working with Feroz Khan, and revealed that the actor-director had once docked her payment for being late to set, Ferozâ€™s son Fardeen Khan has now reacted to her claims, which sheâ€™d shared in an Instagram post.
Taking to the platform on Thursday, Zeenat shared a picture with Feroz, praising the actor and noting that he was the only person she knew who had â€œrizzâ€. She recounted the rocky start to their relationship in the â€™70s, when she declined a small role in his movie, but later accepted the lead role in Qurbani. In the same post, Zeenat shared a story about being late to the filmâ€™s set after partying all night. Feroz, displeased with her tardiness, cut her pay. Despite this incident, she described Feroz as a cool and talented individual, and said that working on Qurbani remains one of her favourite professional experiences.

"As the Sankranti/Pongal weekend approaches, bringing with it a lineup of highly-anticipated big-budget films, it appears that director Prashanth Neelâ€™s Salaar: Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire is unlikely to surpass the box office collection of Siddharth Anandâ€™s Pathaan, let alone Atlee Kumarâ€™s Jawan and Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Animal, based on current trends.
Although the Prabhas-starrer had a strong start and outperformed the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Jawan (Rs 75 crore) as the biggest opener of 2023, earning over Rs 90 crore on day one, the film has been witnessing a massive decline in its daily box office earnings. Despite it being only 15 days since the movieâ€™s release, Salaarâ€™s collection has plunged to below Rs 5 crore in India."
"Shah Rukh Khanâ€˜s Dunki has successfully completed a fortnight in theatres. As per industry tracking website Sacnilk, Dunkiâ€™s box office on Friday (January 5) was Rs 2.20 crore, taking its total India nett earnings to Rs 208.67 crore. According to the filmâ€™s production house, Red Chillies Entertainment, director Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s has earned Rs 422.99 crore at the global box office, which means that it will overtake Chennai Expressâ€™ Rs 423 crore lifetime gross today to become the third-biggest hit of SRKâ€™s career behind Jawan and Pathaan. Incidentally, each of these films was released in 2023.
Also starring Taapsee Pannu and Vikcy Kaushal, Dunki is holding well at the box office, but it hasnâ€™t been able to match the lifetime box office performance of Hiraniâ€™s earlier films, like the Ranbir Kapoor-starrer Sanju, which made Rs Rs 588 crore worldwide during its theatrical run in 2017, and Aamir Khanâ€™s PK (2014) whose total gross was Rs 769.89 crore.

"An ever-romantic Aravind Swamy singing his heart out for his love; a charismatic Mohanlal and Aishwarya Rai dancing in the rain, exposing the governmentâ€™s inefficiency; a heartthrob Shah Rukh Khan grooving atop a moving train, rendering one of the most influential Hindi songs ever; a charming Madhavan and Shalini setting couple goals; a devoted father and mother expressing love for their daughter, enumerating her significance to them; a mesmerising Aishwarya Rai savouring the rains in the lush green landscapes of rural India; a Raavan realising the true glory of Sita; a modern couple reflects on love in todayâ€™s context while traversing familiar surroundings; and a track mapping the thoughts of a Chola commander.
These are just a few songs that AR Rahman and Mani Ratnam have created in the past 32 years since the two began joining forces. This list doesnâ€™t even have one song each from all their movies, let alone their entire discography. Yet, just the aforementioned songs show that the impact of music composer AR Rahman, celebrating his 56th birthday this Saturday, and filmmaker Mani Ratnam on Indian cinema is unparalleled. They have bestowed the visual art with some of the greatest tracks with extraordinary visuals, mutually enhancing each otherâ€™s brilliance, extracting the best from their collaboration, and ensuring the enduring timelessness of their songs and movies.

"We are often told not to think about our past, fearing it might hold us back. After all, living in hindsight is always rosier than dealing with the present. The past has always been a source of misery as well as comfort for me. But some life events â€“ broken friendships, the inevitable challenges of aging parents, and the overarching responsibilities of relationships â€“ compelled me to reassess the present.
After years of consciously sidestepping my past, I unexpectedly found a mirror of my experience in Shailaja Desai, a character brought to life by Shefali Shah in Avinash Arun Dhawareâ€™s Three of Us. Shailaja, a woman teetering on the edge of dementia, visits the small town of her childhood years, and the friends she had fought hard to forget during her bustling life in Mumbai.

"A crucial scene from Jeo Babyâ€™s brilliant Kaathal-The Core reminded me of a man I interviewed a decade back. In the scene, Mathew (a brilliant Mammooty), a middle-aged married man fighting a divorce case, takes the stand. His wife, Omana (Jyothika), has declared in her petition that he is gay and has subjected her to mental â€œcrueltyâ€. He is asked by the opposition lawyer if he thinks being gay is a natural thing, he answers in affirmative. She then asks him if he is gay, his answer is a swift â€œnoâ€.
The story I reported was about gay men who choose to get married to women, without coming out to them. After a doctor of Delhiâ€™s AIIMS died by suicide, stating in her suicide note that she had discovered that her husband was gay, we interviewed gay men across the country, on condition of anonymity, of course. I met one such man in a Kolkata bar. Much like Mathew, he was fighting a particularly messy divorce battle with a woman he had been married to for a few years. His wife wanted divorce on similar grounds, she accused him of cruelty. He talked about growing up being attracted to women, he talked about his many relationships with other men, but he kept insisting that his (then) wife was lying about him. That he can be married to his wife, though he is only attracted to men. As journalists, we are trained to not judge our subjects, but I hated that man then. He made me feel ashamed of being a gay man. Itâ€™s so easy to be ashamed of oneself when you live on the fringes.

The actor said that he doesnâ€™t have Shah Rukhâ€™s number and added, â€œI was scared to ask Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s number. I have his managerâ€™s number.

â€œWhen I write, I write for fun or I write for other people !!!â€ she wrote. â€œIâ€™ve written over 20 songs for other people the past two years !!! Iâ€™m a ghostwriter and I honestly enjoy it that way !!!â€

Just after being released from the conservatorship later that year, she took to Instagram to say she was scared of the music business and that not doing her own music was an act of defiance against her family.

Before Dunki, the actor has given noteworthy performances in various films and shows, including Bobby Deol-starrer Ashram. In a recent interview, the actor revisited his experience of working with Bobby and also shared how Dunki director Rajkumar Hirani didnâ€™t â€™embarrassâ€™ his actors despite knowing that they got drunk for a scene.
During a chat with Siddharth Kannan, Kocchar shared that Bobby loves drinking, and during the shoot of Ashram, he loved to party with the entire cast of the web series.

"Director Rohit Shetty made his Bollywood debut with Ajay Devgn and Abhishek Bachchan-led action-thriller Zameen in 2003, but it failed to impress the audience at the time. So, the filmmaker decided to make another thriller with Devgn in the lead. But destiny had different plans. Shetty ended up making a comedy-drama, Golmaal, which gained a cult status over the years. In a recent interview, he revealed how Golmaal happened and how he zeroed in on the cast of the film.
Golmaal was released in 2005. It starred Ajay Devgn, Sharman Joshi, Arshad Warsi, Tusshar Kapoor, Rimi Sen, and Paresh Rawal, among others. The film was the idea of writer-director Neeraj Vora, who wrote films like Hera Pheri (2000), Ajnabee (2001), Hulchul (2004) and Bhagam Bhag (2007), among several others.

"Itâ€™s interesting that in this film that is all about the herd, the zebra is a running metaphor â€“ or rather, a standing one. As evolutionary biology professor Paul Mathews (Cage) keeps telling his university students, we are all wrong when we see the African equineâ€™s black and white stripes as a way of camouflage. Rather, the zebraâ€™s strength lies in blending in, into a herd, thus confusing the predator that canâ€™t tell one from the other.
The one that pops its head up is a goner."
"Actor Janhvi Kapoor recently visited Tirupati temple and she was accompanied by rumoured boyfriend Shikhar Pahariya. Dressed in a silk saree, the actor looked happy as she made the spiritual trip.

"Filmmaker Rohit Shetty, known for packing his films with intriguing action sequences, recently shared how Akshay Kumar is so daring and doesnâ€™t do anything extraordinary to stay fit and healthy. Shetty also revealed how back in the day, it was more dangerous for actors to perform their own stunts, leaving them with several fractures and stitches.
While speaking to comedians, Bharti Singh and Haarsh Limbachiya for their podcast, Shetty shared that while todayâ€™s generation doesnâ€™t realise the power of natural food items, Akshay Kumar maintains his physique only by eating simple food. He said, â€œAkshay Kumar eats normal food and does normal exercise. He doesnâ€™t even do weights. If itâ€™s a building with 80 floors, he will climb it, he will do 50 pull-ups, he will eat early, he is quite disciplined.â€

"Director JA Bayonaâ€™s horror sensibilities often get the better of him, regardless of whether heâ€™s making a sombre drama or one of the most expensive films in history. Fresh off the success of his Spanish-language thriller The Orphanage, Bayona couldnâ€™t help but ramp up the scares in The Impossible, the weepy that he directed about the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Nor could he resist inserting a scene straight out of gothic horror in the otherwise forgettable Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. But neither killer waves nor giant dinosaurs are scarier than the true story that he has decided to dramatise in his latest film, Spainâ€™s official entry to this yearâ€™s Oscars, Society of the Snow.
Released on Netflix as a part of the streamerâ€™s leaner-than-usual awards season slate, the epic survival drama revisits the famous 1972 Andes flight disaster, which left around two dozen Uruguayans â€” mostly young men â€” stranded at the top of a snow-clad mountain. Rescue efforts were called off after a week or so, after search planes flew over the survivors more than once, but cruelly failed to spot them because the wreckage had blended in with the snow.

"Is there anything more explosive and high-octane than the Rohit Shetty world? Itâ€™s highly unlikely and the trailer for his debut cop action series Indian Police Force emphasises the same. If anything, Shettyâ€™s Cop Universe is set to be even more expansive and thrilling this time, featuring a greater number of cars soaring into the air than ever before.
The much-awaited trailer of the series, unveiled on Friday, opens with a dramatic explosion, followed by a dialogue from one of the cops stating that the incident â€œisnâ€™t an attack on a market, but on our courage and commitment,â€ encouraging fellow officers to swiftly resolve the case.

â€œWe donâ€™t play games; the Delhi police ends the game,â€ declares SP Kabir Malik IPS (Sidharth Malhotra), echoed by a resounding â€œyes sir!â€ from his subordinates reverberating across the police headquarters.

Despite the high motivation, the team, consisting of Kabir, Anjali Shetty (Shilpa Shetty Kundra) and Vikram Bakshi (Vivek Oberoi), struggles to identify the culprits, compounding the challenges faced by the Delhi Police. Meanwhile, conflicts arise among team members, exacerbating the situation. But fret not; the determined cops refuse to yield and are prepared to confront the challenges head-on.
Created by Rohit Shetty, the cop action drama series also stars Shweta Tiwari, Nikitin Dheer, Rituraj Singh, Mukesh Rishi and Lalit Parimoo in key roles. Indian Police Force will start streaming on Amazon Prime Video on January 19, 2024.
According to an official statement from the streaming giant, the series pays a heartfelt tribute to the selfless service, unwavering commitment and fierce patriotism of Indian police officers who put everything on the line in their call of duty to keep the nation safe. The show comprises seven episodes.

Sharing his thoughts on the trailer launch day, Sidharth Malhotra said, â€œProud to don the Khaki vardi in Indian Police Force, the next chapter of the cop universe with maestro Rohit Shetty. Portraying our brave hearts is always a huge responsibility, and being able to do that through Kabir Malikâ€™s character was an honour. The commitment and relentless pursuit of the truth, even in the face of danger, reflect the true spirit of our nationâ€™s police force. The narrative of this cop action drama delves deeper into the sacrifices made by our police officers to ensure the nationâ€™s safety. Excited to take the audiences on a thrilling and entertaining journey, celebrating and honouring our real-life heroes. Jai Hind.â€

â€œBeing a part of the Indian Police Force was a transformative experience for me. Itâ€™s not just a cop series; itâ€™s a tribute to the unsung heroes of our nation â€“ the brave police officers,â€ said actor Shilpa Shetty. â€œIndian Police Force packs an adrenaline rush from the word go, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. Collaborating with Rohit Shetty for my first web series in his cop universe as the 1st female cop, was truly a big moment for me. His vision and experience in the cop milieu has added a unique intensity to the portrayal of law enforcement officers on celluloid. Being a female cop in the series, engaging in action sequences was both empowering and exhilarating. My part is a strong character showcasing that strength and resilience know no gender, and I am proud to be part of a series that celebrates the diversity of our Indian Police Force.â€

"After Abhishek Kumar was evicted by Ankita Lokhande on Bigg Boss 17, his father has issued a statement on social media requesting Salman Khan to give him another chance on the show. In a video shared on social media, Abhishekâ€™s father said that everyone is on the show to win and they all provoke each other, but the way Samarth Jurel and Isha Malviya provoked his son was too much.
â€œThe way Isha and Samarth have been provoking Abhishek, no one else did it that way. They mocked his mental health issues and spoke about his father,â€ he said and declared that this was â€œnot right.â€ Abhishek, who slapped his co-contestant Samarth on the show, was described as â€œemotionalâ€ by his father. He requested Salman to allow his son to re-enter the show. â€œSalman, you have a big heart. You have helped so many people, please forgive my son. Please let him inside Bigg Boss again,â€ he said.

"The inception of the YSR Congress started a new chapter not just in Andhra Pradesh, but the whole of India. The success of the party reinforced the idea of federalism, that has been a core tenet of the country. Yatra 2, directed by Mahi V Raghav and starring Jiiva, is all about the origin of the party and the struggles Jaganmohan Reddy faced in bringing in changing the political landscape of the state.
The teaser reveals that unlike the first part, which was a sober human drama, Yatra 2 will be more over-the-top with respect to the political feud that ensued between the Congress party and Jaganmohan Reddy after the death of YS Rajasekhara Reddy.

Others taking the stage will be Julia Garner, George Lopez and Justin Hartley. Yeoh is returning to the Globes a year after she won best actress in a drama film for Everything Everywhere All at Once, delivering a poignant acceptance speech (and a semi-serious threat to beat up the piano player who started to cut her off).
Check out | Golden Globes 2024 nominations: The complete list
Wednesdayâ€™s announcement is the latest indicator that stars are likely to return to the show as it continues to attempt a return to form after several scandal-tarnished years. The show is known for its boozy celebration of film and television and as an early stop for awards season contenders. Scandals have led to a membership revamp and a new broadcaster for the Jan 7 show, but a key question remains: Will viewers tune in? Hereâ€™s more to know about the 81st Golden Globe Awards.
ADVERTISEMENT
How can I watch the Golden Globes?
Viewers in the United States can catch the ceremony, broadcast live from the Beverly Hilton Hotel, beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern. It will air beginning at 5 p.m. on the West Coast. The three-hour show will have a strong lead-in since CBS is airing an NFL game directly before the Globes. CBS says the show will air on its app and stream on Paramount+, but thereâ€™s an important caveat. Only Paramount+ subscribers with the Showtime add-on will be able to watch the show live. Otherwise, itâ€™ll be available on the streaming platform on Monday.

Whatâ€™s new with the Golden Globes?
The 81st Golden Globe Awards will be the first major broadcast of the awards season, with a new home on CBS. And while to audiences it might look similar on the surface, itâ€™s been a tumultuous few years behind the scenes following a bombshell report in the Los Angeles Times. The 2021 report found that there were no Black members in the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which voted on the awards. Stars and studios boycotted the Globes and NBC refused to air it in 2022 as a result. After the group added journalists of colour to its ranks and instituted other reforms to address ethical concerns, the show came back in January 2023 in a one-year probationary agreement with NBC. The network did not opt to renew. In June, billionaire Todd Boehly was granted approval to dissolve the HFPA and reinvent the Golden Globes as a for-profit organization. Its assets were acquired by Boehlyâ€™s Eldridge Industries, along with Dick Clark Productions, a group that is owned by Penske Media whose assets also include Variety, Deadline, The Hollywood Reporter, Rolling Stone and Billboard. The show has also added a new award for stand-up comedy, with Chris Rock, Amy Schumer and former Globes host Ricky Gervais among the nominees.
Whoâ€™s hosting the Globes?
Comedian Jo Koy, who has headlined several Netflix specials and starred in last yearâ€™s comedy film â€œEaster Sunday,â€ will host the Globes. Organizers cited his â€œinfectious energy and relatable humourâ€ in announcing Koy would headline the event. Hosting the Globes typically requires serving a mix of biting humour to the audience of film and television stars and keeping the ceremony from getting too sloppy. Previous hosts include Ricky Gervais, whose jokes were particularly caustic, the duo of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler and last yearâ€™s emcee, Jerrod Carmichael.

What about 60 Minutes?
The Globes, and New Yearâ€™s Eve celebrations, are keeping 60 Minutes from airing for two weeks. CBS aired New Yearâ€™s Eve Live: Nashvilleâ€™s Big Bash on Sunday. CBS says 60 Minutes will resume on Jan. 14.
Golden Globe nominees
Barbie is the top nominee this year, followed closely by Oppenheimer. The films reflect one unique aspect of the Globes â€” they split the top film winners into two categories. With Greta Gerwigâ€™s Barbie and Christopher Nolanâ€™s Oppenheimer leading the way, it gives the show a chance to capitalize on the Barbenheimer craze that boosted theatres in 2023. Films nominated for best motion picture drama include Oppenheimer, Martin Scorseseâ€™s Killers of the Flower Moon, Bradley Cooperâ€™s Maestro, Celine Songâ€™s Past Lives, Justine Trietâ€™s Anatomy of a Fall and Jonathan Glazerâ€™s The Zone of Interest. In the best motion picture musical or comedy category, Barbie was joined by Ben Affleckâ€™s Air, Cord Jeffersonâ€™s American Fiction, Alexander Payneâ€™s The Holdovers, Todd Haynesâ€™ May December and Yorgos Lanthimosâ€™ Poor Things. Succession was the top-nominated television program, with nine nods including for series stars Brian Cox, Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook and Kieran Culkin, followed by Huluâ€™s The Bear.

What are the Globes known for?
The Golden Globe Awards had long been one of the highest-profile awards season broadcasts, second only to the Oscars. The show was touted as an A-list party whose hosts often took a more irreverent tone than their Academy counterparts. It also only honoured the flashiest filmmaking categories â€” picture, director, and actors among them â€” meaning no long speeches from visual effects supervisors or directors of little-known shorts. But the voting body was a small group of around 87 members who wielded incredible influence in the industry and often accepted lavish gifts and travel from studios and awards publicists eager to court favour and win votes.

â€” Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 4, 2024
Some years, the HFPA was pilloried for nominating poorly reviewed films with big-name talent in hopes of getting them to the show â€” the most infamous being The Tourist, with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. In the past decade, theyâ€™ve more often overlapped with the Oscars. The show also recognizes television. Before the expose and public relations crisis though, no one in the industry took much umbrage with who was voting on the awards. The show had become an important part of the Hollywood awards ecosystem, a platform for Oscar hopefuls and was, until recently, a reliable ratings draw. As of 2019, the broadcast was still pulling in nearly 19 million viewers. In 2023, NBCâ€™s Tuesday night broadcast got its smallest audience ever for a traditional broadcast, with 6.3 million viewers.

"Shark Tankâ€™s Vineeta Singh added her two cents about the controversial film Animal, and said that while she generally supports the exploration of dark themes in cinema, she felt that the filmâ€™s protagonist wasnâ€™t adequately punished for his bad behaviour. In a new interview, she said that she had similar feelings about the film Kabir Singh, also directed by Animalâ€™s Sandeep Reddy Vanga.
Vineeta, the CEO of Sugar Cosmetics, became a household name after appearing on the first season of Shark Tank India. On Ranveer Allahbadiaâ€™s podcast recently, she was asked about Animal, and she said, â€œI broadly agree that art is art, and when a fictional character is created, regardless of whether heâ€™s played by Ranbir Kapoor or Shakti Kapoor, heâ€™s still a fictional character. Hollywood makes such films regularly, look at Quentin Tarantinoâ€™s films. I was arguing with my friends about Kabir Singh and Animalâ€¦ The only thing I agree with is this: in India, weâ€™ve seen for so many years, bad guys lose in the end; they get what they deserve. The good guy always wins.â€

"Tamil star Ajith Kumar is a private person, and he is extremely particular about his space despite being one of the leading superstars of Tamil cinema. However, time and again, he gets embroiled in controversy for the same reason. The Tamil superstar is spending the New Year week in Dubai along with his wife Shalini and family and videos of the star couple have gone viral on social media. One such clip shows Ajith holding the phone of a fan and deleting the video he had taken of the star.

She said that sheâ€™d prefer to keep certain sides to her personality hidden from the public, because oneâ€™s social media persona can often influence how theyâ€™re perceived by the audience. Janhvi said that she isnâ€™t â€˜equippedâ€™ to calculate how to use social media to her advantage, as she quoted Spacey.
The Hollywood actor, once regarded as among the finest of his generation, was accused by several people of sexual misconduct during the #MeToo movement in 2017. Netflix severed ties with him, removing him from the final season of House of Cards, while director Ridley Scott replaced him in his film All the Money in the World. Last year, Spacey was acquitted of sexual assault charges by a jury in London. Spacey has denied the charges, but his career has been severely impacted by them.

"Glynis Johns, a Tony Award-winning stage and screen star who played the mother opposite Julie Andrews in the classic movie Mary Poppins and introduced the world to the bittersweet standard-to-be â€œSend in the Clownsâ€ by Stephen Sondheim, has died. She was 100.
Mitch Clem, her manager, said she died Thursday at an assisted living home in Los Angeles of natural causes. â€œTodayâ€™s a sad day for Hollywood,â€ Clem said. â€œShe is the last of the last of old Hollywood.â€ Johns was known to be a perfectionist about her profession â€” precise, analytical and opinionated. The roles she took had to be multi-faceted. Anything less was giving less than her all.

â€œAs far as Iâ€™m concerned, Iâ€™m not interested in playing the role on only one level,â€ she told The Associated Press in 1990. â€œThe whole point of first-class acting is to make a reality of it. To be real. And I have to make sense of it in my own mind in order to be real.â€ Johnsâ€™ greatest triumph was playing Desiree Armfeldt in A Little Night Music, for which she won a Tony in 1973. Sondheim wrote the showâ€™s hit song â€œSend in the Clownsâ€ to suit her distinctive husky voice, but she lost the part in the 1977 film version to Elizabeth Taylor.

â€œIâ€™ve had other songs written for me, but nothing like that,â€ Johns told the AP in 1990. â€œItâ€™s the greatest gift Iâ€™ve ever been given in the theatre.â€ Others who followed Johns in singing Sondheimâ€™s most popular song include Frank Sinatra, Judy Collins, Barbra Streisand, Sarah Vaughan and Olivia Newton-John. It also appeared in season two of â€œYellowjacketsâ€ in 2023, sung by Elijah Wood.
Back when it was being conceived, â€œA Little Night Musicâ€ had gone into rehearsal with some of the book and score unfinished, including a solo song for Johns. Director Hal Prince suggested she and co-star Len Cariou improvise a scene or two to give book writer Hugh Wheeler some ideas.
â€œHal said Why donâ€™t you just say what you feel,â€ she recalled to the AP. â€œWhen Len and I did that, Hal got on the phone to Steve Sondheim and said, I think youâ€™d better get in a cab and get round here and watch what theyâ€™re doing because you are going to get the idea for Glynisâ€™ solo.â€ Johns was the fourth generation of an English theatrical family. Her father, Mervyn Johns, had a long career as a character actor and her mother was a pianist. She was born in Pretoria, South Africa, because her parents were visiting the area on tour at the time of her birth.
Johns was a dancer at 12 and an actor at 14 in Londonâ€™s West End. Her breakthrough role was as the amorous mermaid in the title of the 1948 hit comedy Miranda.

â€œI was quite an athlete, my muscles were strong from dancing, so the tail was just fine; I swam like a porpoise,â€ she told Newsday in 1998. In 1960â€™s The Sundowners, with Deborah Kerr and Robert Mitchum, she was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar. (She lost out to Shirley Jones in Elmer Gantry).
Other highlights include playing the mother in Mary Poppins, the movie that introduced Julie Andrews and where she sang the rousing tune â€œSister Suffragetteâ€. She also starred in the 1989 Broadway revival of The Circle, W Somerset Maughamâ€™s romantic comedy about love, marriage and fidelity, opposite Rex Harrison and Stewart Granger.
â€œIâ€™ve retired many times. My personal life has come before my work. The theatre is just part of my life. It probably uses my highest sense of intelligence, so therefore I have to come back to it, to realize that Iâ€™ve got the talent. Iâ€™m not as good doing anything else,â€ she told the AP.
To prepare for A Coffin in Egypt, Horton Footeâ€™s 1998 play about a grand dame reminiscing about her life on and off a ranch on the Texas prairie, she asked the Texas-born Foote to record a short tape of himself reading some lines and used it as her coach.
ADVERTISEMENT
In a 1991 revival of A Little Night Music in Los Angeles, she played Madame Armfeldt, the mother of Desiree, the part she had created. In 1963, she starred in her own TV sitcom â€œGlynisâ€.
Johns lived all around the world and had four husbands. The first was the father of her only child, the late Gareth Forwood, an actor who died in 2007.

"Harry Johnson, an actor with credits ranging from the original Battlestar Galactica to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, various Dick Wolf programmes, and the famed Harry & Louise ads, died on January 2 in Los Angeles after a protracted illness, Deadline reported. He was 81. Christiane, his wife, confirmed his death to Deadline.
Born on December 27, 1942, in Plainfield, New Jersey, he was known as Chip Johnson in the 1970s and 1980s and was one of Universal Studiosâ€™ final contract performers.
Johnson began his screen career with the multi-part pilot episode of Battlestar Galactica in 1978 and went on to guest-star on dozens of TV series, including M*A*S*H, Quincy M.E., The Incredible Hulk, Simon & Simon, The Greatest American Hero, Highway to Heaven, The A-Team, Whoâ€™s the Boss?, Thirtysomething, Melrose Place, Party of Five, Days of Our Lives and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. He was a prominent ADR voice actor who has contributed to several Need for Speed video games. For more than two decades, Johnson was the voice-over or looping group on several Dick Wolf episodes, including all of the Law & Order and Chicago series.
ADVERTISEMENT
He also acted in films such as Real Genius, Warlock, and The Spitfire Grill, as well as various TV films, most notably Time Warp, in which he co-starred with Batman veteran Adam West.
Johnson famously played Harry in a series of Harry & Louise TV and radio commercials against President Bill Clintonâ€™s health-care proposal in 1993-94.
The Health Insurance Association of America funded the advertising, which was so popular (one famous slogan was â€˜If you let the government choose, we loseâ€™) that the Democratic National Committee later produced response ads. In 2000 and 2004, Johnson and Louise Claire Clark reprised their roles in election-year ads.
Harry and Louise reappeared in an ad that aired at the 2008 Democratic National Convention and again the following year, this time for a commercial promoting President Barack Obamaâ€™s new health-care proposal.
ADVERTISEMENT
The commercials were imitated during the 2006 Oscars broadcast, featuring a voiceover by Stephen Colbert, then-host of The Colbert Report.
Johnson went on to write books under the pen name Harry Castle. His debut novel, Fugitive Romance, the Fictional Memoir of a Hollywood Screenwriter, was published in 2013, while his second book, Miracles & Misfits, was a collection of short stories.
Johnsonâ€™s wife told Deadline that he loved to sail and was well-known among coworkers for his humour and habit of bringing a lightness to settings, making work enjoyable.
Johnson is survived by his stepchildren Oliver and Penelope, as well as his wife of 15 years, Christiane."

"Shah Rukh Khan ended his 2023 with the release of Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s Dunki and the filmâ€™s cast members could not stop showering praise on King Khan. In a recent interview, Vikram Kochhar, who played Baggu in the film, said that Shah Rukh takes care of everyone on the set and pays attention to everyoneâ€™s work.
In a chat with Lallantop Cinema, Vikram said, â€œShah Rukh sir is like a rajwada (royal). He will welcome you so gently. He will greet you, make you comfortable, talk to you. He will ask you questions about yourself, where you are from. Whenever he meets you, he gives a hug. Sometimes when he is feeling a lot of love, he will give you a kiss on the head. When he really likes what you have done in a scene, he will come and say â€˜you have done really well todayâ€™. He is a lovely and charming person.â€

"Director Abhishek Chaubey, who found himself at the centre of one of Bollywoodâ€™s biggest controversies of the last decade when his film Udta Punjab came under the CBFCâ€™s scanner, said that were a similar situation to transpire today, the industry wouldnâ€™t stand up for him like it did. Released in 2016, Udta Punjab was heavily censored by the CBFC, which advised the filmmakers to remove all references to Punjab. The crime film dealt directly with the drug epidemic in the state.
At the time, producer Anurag Kashyap led the resistance against then-CBFC chief Pahlaj Nihalani, while several prominent members of the film industry voiced support for Chaubey. In an interview with Sucharita Tyagi, the director said that he wouldnâ€™t get the same level of support were he to find himself in a similar predicament now. â€œThe times have changed,â€ he said.

"Actor Aamir Khanâ€™s daughter, Ira Khan, tied the knot in one of the most unusual celebrity weddings in recent memory. Her groom, Nupur Shikhare, jogged to the wedding venue in Mumbai, wearing a gym vest and shorts, and proceeded to complete the registration in the same outfit. He later changed into a sherwani, as he posed with Ira and their parents. Nupurâ€™s choice of outfit and running to the venue has led to memes and much chatter online.
On Thursday, Ira took to Instagram stories to repost several congratulatory messages from guests at the wedding, and in one story referenced Nupurâ€™s choice of attire. â€œHe didnâ€™t come on a horse, he ran to the venue, and I placed cute posters along the way,â€ she wrote, adding a smiley face emoji. The picture showed Nupur and Ira giving a joint speech on stage, while an inset image showed Nupurâ€™s jog.

"Bobby Deol has had many comebacks in the last few years but none of those worked quite like Animal. In Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s film, Bobby played a small role that appeared on the screen for less than 15 minutes but left enough impact that the audience could not stop talking about him after the film. In his many interviews shortly after the release of the film, the actor spoke about his long wait for recognition and how this phase of his career has given him a lot more than he could have expected. Now, it seems like the reactions of Bobbyâ€™s fame arenâ€™t just virtual.
Recently, when Bobby was trying to exit the Mumbai airport without any security, he was mobbed by fans who wanted to get a selfie with him. Bobby could not stop smiling as he was loving the attention. Fans in the comment section suggested that Bobby should probably invest in hiring a security team now as that would help him in navigating crowds.

"Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Dunki has been in the theatres for a little over two weeks. The filmâ€™s box office collections have been stuck in single digit numbers for almost all of its second week, the numbers declined further on Thursday. On its 15th day in the cinemas, Dunki made Rs 2.65 crore, as per industry tracker Sacnilk, taking its domestic nett collections to Rs 206.53 crore.
Dunkiâ€™s global box office collection stands at Rs 417.1 crore, as per the filmâ€™s producers Red Chillies Entertainment. Dunki released with Salaar which dominated the box office. While it does not have much competition at the theatres for the next couple of weeks, it seems rather difficult for the film to cross the Rs 500 crore mark.

"The Prabhas-starrer Salaar continued its downward trajectory at the box office on its 14th day of release. According to industry tracker Sacnilk, the action-thriller made an estimated Rs 4.5 crore on Thursday, and this takes its total domestic collections to Rs 378 crore. The film still has a strong chance of passing the Rs 400 crore mark domestically, although it has been highly front-loaded.
Salaar opened to Rs 90 crore on day one, and made over Rs 300 crore in its first week alone. But despite the less-than-encouraging trajectory that the film has shown â€“ drops like this are emblematic of poor audience response â€“ the film has emerged as Prabhasâ€™ biggest hit since Baahubali 2: The Conclusion, and the third-biggest Telugu-language movie of all time. Prabhas can now boast about having led three of the top four films on this list, although Salaar has grossed roughly half of what Baahubali 2 did worldwide. The only outlier is RRR, starring Ram Charan and Jr NTR.

"How to become a celebrity? Imagine a high-end supermarket, where the top-shelf shiny item is the movie celebrity-starter pack. People can access it, but not everyone is able to use it. Its ingredients are simple, but not easy achievableâ€“ popularity that cuts across gender, region and age, box office numbers to flex, cultural impact for its time and, of course, legacy. In 2023, the ingredient of the starter pack perhaps has undergone a slight change; it now includesâ€“but isnâ€™t limited toâ€“social media following. Does it still taste well?
From Bollywoodâ€™s point of view, 2023 will be earmarked as the triumphant return of Shah Rukh Khan. His films smashed records, made fans sing and dance, created a stir and continued to win new audience. But away from the shadow of the offline mega stardom on display, birthed, lived and became stronger a new breed of starsâ€“ the online kind.

"There is an end credits sequence in Imtiaz Aliâ€™s Tamasha, where Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s Ved and Deepika Padukoneâ€™s Tara are back in Corsica, dancing alone, happily, with headphones plugged in. The world hears faint atmospheric sound, but they dance to a great AR Rahman music in their head. Thatâ€™s pretty much how Deepika Padukone, one of the biggest female stars of the generation, has led her life off screen. Over a clearly soaring Bollywood career with major tumultuous phases, she has mastered one crucial art: Of remaining quiet and turning all the noise around her into musical notes. The actor, who celebrates her 38th birthday on Friday, has always been dancing her way.
Only a few female stars, who made their debut in the last decade or so, have been able to stamp their identity so strongly in public conscience the way Deepika Padukone has. And it isnâ€™t even about her movie catalogue anymore, which anyway oscillates between big blockbusters, projects with prestige directors and a few charming mid-sized projects. Deepika Padukone in 2023 stands as the sum total of not only how the audience has reacted to her through the years but also how she has handled those reactions.

Elvis Evolution will use AI and holographic projection, augmented reality and live theatre to recreate events in Presleyâ€™s life and music, said Layered Reality, the immersive entertainment company developing the show.

The 61-year-old director, who just directed Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Dunki, said the show will be available on Disney+Hotstar.
â€œIâ€™m doing an OTT show, which we actually start shooting this month. Iâ€™m a showrunner for that, Iâ€™m not directing it. Itâ€™s a show for Hotstar (Disney+ Hotstar) and Vikrant Massey is playing a role in it.

â€œItâ€™s something Iâ€™m very happy about with the script and the way it has panned out. On this show, Iâ€™m really involved and itâ€™s in my own space,â€ said Hirani.
Indian Express Entertainment is now on WhatsApp Channels. Follow us for the latest news, interviews, reviews, photos and more.
Hirani, known for his slice-of-life movies such as the Munnabhai series, 3 Idiots, PK and Sanju, also has a couple of feature ideas that he wants to develop next.
â€œLuckily, COVID-19 gave us the time to sit at home and work on more scripts. Iâ€™m working on more scripts now. In a month or so, weâ€™ll start deciding where we will go,â€ he said.

Before he made 3 Idiots, Hirani was to direct the third part of the Munnabhai series, which even had a title and a teaser but he did not go ahead with it.
Asked whether the third installment is still a possibility, Hirani said it has been on his mind for a while now but he does not want to direct it without a great story and just to capitalise on the popularity of his first two movies, Munnabhai MBBS in 2003 and Lage Raho Munnabhai in 2006, starring Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi as an affable goon and his sidekick.
â€œItâ€™s not that I donâ€™t want to do it, 100 per cent I want to do it because I had fun making those films. After every film, Iâ€™ve tried to write one Munnabhai. So, Iâ€™ve five unfinished Munna Bhai scripts lying with me with various titles such as Munna Bhai Chale America, Munna Bhai BA LLB, and Munna Bhai Chal Basse.
â€œThere are many scripts written but none of them reached that level of greatness. I know that any Munnabhai that I make will make a huge amount of money now. But I donâ€™t want to make it for that reason,â€ Hirani said.

The filmmaker said he has a lot of gratitude because his first film continues to be in the public consciousness 20 years after its release.

â€œI just feel gratitude towards life because nobody thought that films that were made 20 years ago would still be talked about, the lingo, the dialogues will still be in the psyche of this generation and you will still see memes,â€ Hirani said.
â€œI shot an ad with Sanju and Arshad recently where they are playing Munna and Circuit, and an ad film is made on a film thatâ€™s 20 years old with these characters. The reason I did that ad was to work with them. Itâ€™s genuinely fun to be working with Arshad and Sanju on the sets, and I hope I can do it someday (again),â€ said the director.

Released on December 21, Dunki has earned over Rs 409 crore globally since its release. The movie also stars Boman Irani, Taapsee Pannu, Vicky Kaushal, Vikram Kochhar, and Anil Grover, among others.

However, Katrina responded with grace and defended her portrayal in the Salman Khan-starrer.
Addressing the press, Katrina said, â€œI see things a little different perhaps. I actually think the character of Zoya is one of the strongest characters Iâ€™ve ever had the chance to play. Especially in Tiger 3, it was so nuanced and so well-written by Maneesh Sharma. I thoroughly enjoyed being able to play that character.â€

"Vijay Sethupathi will be seen next in filmmaker Sriram Raghavanâ€™s next â€” Merry Christmas â€” with Katrina Kaif. The actor recently spoke about why he is attracted towards negative and complex roles as he promoted the film in Mumbai on Thursday.
In his last Hindi film Jawaan, directed by Atlee, Sethupathi played the antogonist opposite Shah Rukh Khan. Talking about his liking for complex and villain roles, he said, â€œEverything is complex.

"Actor Tanishaa Mukerji, daughter of veteran Bollywood star Tanuja and sister of Kajol, started her acting career in 2003 with the film Sssshhhâ€¦The film didnâ€™t find any takers. Subsequently, her following films also failed to give wings to her career. At this point, her brother-in-law and Bollywood actor Ajay Devgn stepped in to help her.
In a recent interview, Tanishaa shared that Ajay helped her after she was out of work for about 2-3 years. She told Siddharth Kannan, â€œAjay came in later. He realised, â€˜Ye kya ho raha hai (what is happening with her career)â€™ and then he was like, â€˜Wait a minute baby, let me come in.â€™ He came after my launch and after I was out of work for about 2-3 years. It all went downhill. Then Ajay got me a secretary. At that time, there were secretaries. KS Sanjay was fixed as my secretary by Ajay.â€

A recent report on Sacnilk, posted at 6 pm, suggests that the film is anticipated to generate around Rs 2.8 crore on Thursday, bringing its total domestic collection to over Rs 376 crore.
Salaar, which is almost through its second week, had amassed a total of Rs 308 crore in its first week.

"As expected Dhanushâ€˜s Captain Miller seems to be a violent film. Director Arun Matheshwaranâ€™s films are known for the aesthetic portrayal of violence and looks like we will get to see the same in the upcoming Pongal release. The censor board certificate details of the movie, which is currently viral among Dhanush fans, hint that the film is high on violence and expletives.
The censor board has asked the makers to make several changes to the scenes and dialogues. CBFC has asked the makers to remove all the demeaning words about white people and the British. Words like Vellakaraga naaigal (White dogs) and white pigs have been asked to be muted. Other Tamil expletives have also faced cuts. On top of that, CBFC has asked to cut the violence toward the end of the film by 40 per cent. It has also asked the makers to â€˜modify the visuals of blood spurts, blood splash wherever it occurs.â€™ Due to all of these changes, the film suffers a cut of four-minutes. The final runtime of the film after all the cuts amounts to 157.50 minutes.

"Much has been said about AR Rahmanâ€™s style of working â€” the music composer does his best work late at night. While some hail it as creative, others call it unorganised. Singer Alka Yagnikâ€™s first experience of working with him started with her waiting for him for several hours but ended with feeling satisfied with the musical procedure. Now, she understands why the Oscar-winning music composer prefers working at odd hours.
In an interview with O2 India, Alka recalls working with Rahman for Taal when she and director Subhash Ghai waited for almost five hours for the music maestro to turn up. She said that initially, she did feel impatient.

"The one man who has taught an entire generation how to romance had a rather dramatic love story in real life. Itâ€™s Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s love story with his wife of over three decades, Gauri Khan. The two had a whirlwind romance before their marriage in 1991. They faced opposition from Gauriâ€™s parents because of him being a Muslim. All the drama at home around her relationship with Shah Rukh made Gauri take a break from it.
In a 1994 interview with Filmfare, Gauri had shared why she broke up with Shah Rukh. â€œOh, that was at the beginning when my family had yet to reconcile themselves to the fact that heâ€™s a Muslim. I didnâ€™t want to hurt my family, so I decided to break up with Shah Rukh,â€ shared the interior designer and film producer.

"Actor Janhvi Kapoor spoke about the poor reviews that her last film, Bawaal, received when it was released on Prime Video in 2023. She said that she didnâ€™t see it coming, because sheâ€™d become accustomed to the pure intentions that director Nitesh Tiwari was making the movie with. In a new interview, Janhvi admitted that sheâ€™d put all her eggs in one basket, and was hoping that Bawaal would take things to the next level for her.
In an interview with Film Companion, Janhvi said that she fought to be a part of Bawaal, and then changed her dates around to ensure that sheâ€™s able to do the film. But the first setback came when she was told that the movie wouldnâ€™t be releasing in theatres at all. Also starring Varun Dhawan, Bawaal followed the story of a mismatched small town couple, who go on a trip to Europe, and discover that their own problems pale in comparison to what the Jews experienced during the Holocaust. As expected, the movie drew criticism for framing a regular coupleâ€™s domestic problems against the backdrop of a mass genocide.

"Actor Janhvi Kapoor said that she has only recently started to stand up for herself, and not â€˜invalidateâ€™ her feelings, after years of not having enough courage to speak out about subjects that she feels strongly about. In an interview with Film Companion, Janhvi said that she didnâ€™t say anything when morphed pictures of her were circulated online when she was just a teenager, because she feared that people would think she was craving attention.
But, she said, she can now say without a shred of indecision that this was wrong. She also praised actor Rashmika Mandanna, who condemned a viral deepfake of herself on social media. â€œItâ€™s strange to say this, given that anything and everything I say, given the context of where I come from sounds likeâ€¦ So, Iâ€™m a little conscious.

"One of the highlights of Jr NTRâ€™s upcoming film Devara: Part 1 is that it marks the debut of Bollywood actor Janhvi Kapoor in the Telugu industry. In a recent interview with Film Companion, Janhvi opened up about how making her debut in Telugu is like a â€˜homecomingâ€™ for her. Janhviâ€™s mother, Sridevi, was a superstar back in the day in both Tamil and Telugu cinema, before she chose to shift her focus to Bollywood. Working in Devara, Janhvi was able to understand what her mom did decades ago.
Talking about working in Devara, she said, â€œItâ€™s a lot of fun. I am having a blast. I think I have gotten to a point where, after doing all these films wherein I am dying in a freezer, dislocating my shoulder, or acting with a rat, I realise I am allowing myself to do what comes naturally to me which is like nautanki, dialoguebaazi, dancing, and just having fun. And doing the kind of roles I have grown up enjoying and loving. I am finally getting to do all in this film. I think I am going easier on myself and allowing myself to enjoy it. I think this is the perfect film to be able to do that.â€

"The Prabhas-starrer Salaar has been playing in theatres for approximately two weeks now, and while the film opened to a whopping Rs 90 crore nett in India, its box office collections started to dip soon after.

On its second Wednesday, the film managed to bring in Rs 5.25 crore in India, taking its nett domestic box office total to Rs 373.57 crore.
Also starring Prithviraj Sukumaran, Tinnu Anand, Jagapathi Babu and Sriya Reddy in significant roles, Salaar is still experiencing 17.97% occupancy in the Telugu market.

"Not many aspiring actors manage to land a launch like Zarin Shihab did back in 2019. Despite having only limited screen time in Raj & DKâ€™s spy thriller series The Family Man, Zarin skillfully portrayed the character Sahaya Mary, a nurse pivotal to the showâ€™s plot, leaving a lasting impression on viewers with her debut performance. Nevertheless, she has been selective in her acting choices, prioritising quality over quantity since then. As a result, Zarin is now gaining significant recognition, especially in her homeland of Kerala, through films and roles that inspire her to push her creative boundaries.
The latest addition to her brief yet impressive filmography is Anand Ekarshiâ€™s debut feature Aattam (The Play), which premiered at the 28th IFFK, receiving rave reviews. Now, as the film prepares for its theatrical release on January 5, Zarin, whose performance captivated viewers at IFFK, eagerly anticipates the broader audienceâ€™s opinions. At its core, the film revolves around a woman who experiences sexual assault in a space she had considered safe and Zarin plays the role of Anjali, the only female member of a drama troupe called Arangu, comprising 12 male actors along with the director.

"Imagine Dil Chahta Hai, but with Instagram aesthetics? Actor-filmmaker Farhan Akhtar says his 2001 directorial debut starring Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna would have been an â€œentirelyâ€ different film if social media existed during the time it was made.
Dil Chahta Hai followed the lives of three college graduates, as they navigate personal challenges which test their friendship. It is often regarded as a landmark Hindi film and perhaps the start of many friendship-based stories, especially coming from Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwaniâ€™s production house Excel Entertainment (Rock On, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara).

She is likely to be accompanied by Arun Govil, who had essayed the role of Lord Ram in the classic television show, which spanned 78 episodes on Doordarshan.
â€œYes, we have been invited to Ayodhya on January 22â€¦ It will be something magical and a historic moment,â€ Chikhlia told PTI in an interview.
â€œI have always said that I am very blessed that I could play Sita ji in Ramayan. It has been a very divine experience to be a part of something as magical as Ramayan. I enjoyed my journey throughout. I was one of those few actors who played Sitaâ€¦ but I continued to remain Sita ji till date. So I think we have all been very blessed,â€ she added.
The temple spread over 70 acres will be open to the public after Prime Minister Narendra Modi does the pran pratishtha, or the consecration ceremony of the Ram Lalla idol, on January 22.

â€œI want to tell everybody that January 22, 2024 is the new date for Diwali. The way Diwali will be celebrated in Ayodhya, similarly everyone should welcome Lord Ram and celebrate Diwali in their homes,â€ said Chikhlia."
"Director Midhun Manuel Thomas is back to his grind with Abraham Ozler. The trailer of the film introduces you to a brooding titular character who seems to be guilt-ridden. We learn he keeps bringing food to a culprit in a prison. Though the reason behind the gesture is unknown, it hints at a dark past to Ozler, who is currently an insomniac and is on the edge. In one instance, he says there is no place even in hell for people like him. And then comes an unsolvable case. Will it absolve him of his past sins or will it awaken the suppressed trauma?
Looks like Midhunâ€™s upcoming film travels the familiar landscape of such crime dramas, but it is intriguing to see Jayaram in such a role, who seems to be pretty comfortable in it. Largely known for his comic sense, Jayaram aces this dark territory too.

"Vikrant Massey was recently seen in one of the most successful films of the year, 12th Fail. In a recent interview, the actor shared that some characters have a hold on the actor and it is difficult to detach oneself from those characters. In 12th Fail, Vikrant played the role of Manoj Kumar Sharma who fights against all odds to crack the UPSC exam.
In a chat with ANI, Vikrant also spoke about the hold of his character in A Death in the Gunj that really disturbed him. â€œSome charactersâ€¦ you just want to tear them apart because they stay with you. What I did in A Death in the Gunj, really stayed with me,â€ he shared and added, â€œThat was the first time, after filming that film, I started taking therapy because I felt I needed to talk to someone. If you tell your parents about your worries, then they get worried so you really canâ€™t share all these things with them. Because it was a very dark film. It pushed me to certain darker corners.â€

"Slashed free of Disneyâ€™s copyright as of Monday, the iconic character from Steamboat Willie is already the focus of two horror films. On Monday, just hours after the 1928 short entered the public domain, a trailer for Mickeyâ€™s Mouse Trap dropped on YouTube. Another yet-to-be-titled film was announced Tuesday.
Steamboat Willie featured early versions of both Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks, it was the third cartoon featuring the duo they made but the first to be released. In it, a more menacing Mickey, bearing more resemblance to rat than mouse, captains a boat and makes musical instruments out of other animals.
Itâ€™s perhaps fitting, then, that the first projects announced are seemingly low-budget and campy slasher movies â€” and not unprecedented. Winnie the Pooh â€” sans red shirt â€” entered the public domain in 2022; scarcely a year later, he was notching up a heavy body count in the microbudget Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey.
ADVERTISEMENT
In the trailer for Mickeyâ€™s Mouse Trap, directed by Jamie Bailey, what appears to be a human in a comically small Mickey mask terrorizes a group of young people at an arcade.
â€œA place for fun. A place for friends. A place for hunting,â€ text flashed during the trailer reads. The mouse is out.
â€œWe just wanted to have fun with it all. I mean itâ€™s Steamboat Willieâ€™s Mickey Mouse murdering people,â€ director Jamie Bailey said in a statement cited by trade publications. â€œItâ€™s ridiculous. We ran with it and had fun doing it and I think it shows.â€
No release date has been set.
The second movie is from director Steven LaMorte, who previously directed a horror parody of The Grinch, which is not in the public domain (the movie is thus called The Mean One).
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œA late-night boat ride turns into a desperate fight for survival in New York City when a mischievous mouse becomes a monstrous reality,â€ is the logline for the untitled film, per a post on LaMorteâ€™s Instagram.
â€œSteamboat Willie has brought joy to generations, but beneath that cheerful exterior lies a potential for pure, unhinged terror,â€ LaMorte said in a release cited by the trades. The movie has yet to begin production.
With the expiration of the 95-year copyright, the public is allowed to use only the initial versions of Mickey and Minnie â€” not the more familiar character designs.
â€œWe will, of course, continue to protect our rights in the more modern versions of Mickey Mouse and other works that remain subject to copyright,â€ Disney said in a statement ahead of the characters entering the public domain.
ADVERTISEMENT
LaMorte told Variety that the producers of his film are working with a legal team so as not to run afoul of Disney, and will call their raging rodent Steamboat Willie instead of Mickey Mouse.
â€œWe are doing our due diligence to make sure thereâ€™s no question or confusion of what weâ€™re up to,â€ he said.

Ibrahim is the son of Saif and his first wife Amrita Singh.
Amitabh asked Sharmila and Sara a fan question that required them to answer who was the most entitled person in the Pataudi family. To this, Sharmila answered with Saraâ€™s name. When asked to elaborate, Sharmila said, â€œWhen Ibrahim was born, I gave my earrings, which I wore for my wedding, to Amrita as that when Ibrahim grows up, it will be for his wife. Guess who has taken it?â€

"Sridevi, an icon star of Indian cinema, was remembered and celebrated by Bollywood celebrities and her family members on her 60th birth anniversary last August. Recently, an intriguing old interview clip featuring veteran actor Jeetendra was circulating on social media, shedding light on how Rekha recommended him to work with Sridevi even before the latter made her Hindi film debut.
In an interview with Zoom, Jeetendra shared the story of how Rekha suggested him to work with Sridevi while they were watching a Telugu film featuring the late actor. Recounting the incident, Jeetendra said, â€œOne time me and Rekha were watching a Telugu film (which starred Sridevi). Rekha was suppose to play the female lead in Himaatwala at the time. While we were watching the Telugu film, Rekha kept telling me that, â€˜You should work with her.â€™ I told her I will definitely work with her. I think Rekha couldnâ€™t give her dates for Himaatwala and then the filmâ€™s director K Raghavendra Rao said letâ€™s take Sridevi.â€

In a mid-week eviction on Bigg Boss 17, content creator Anurag Dobhal, aka UK Rider 07, had to leave the show. The housemates collectively named him for elimination, bringing a rather bumpy journey of Anurag to an end. Talking to Indianexpress.com Anurag shared how unhappy he has been with the showâ€™s makers. â€œI am happy that people understood my pattern. I had never watched Bigg Boss, so I was not sure what to do there. I was not trying to be pitch-perfect, I tried showing the real Anurag since it is a reality show. I went low when Salman sir said things about the â€˜Bro Senaâ€™, it was an emotional setback for me,â€ he said in an interview after being evicted.
"Amitabh Bachchan has performed many heroic stunts in his movies but not many know that Big B is just as heroic in his real-life as well. Bachchan has walked across fire, jumped from top of tall buildings and even faced a near-fatal accident during his movies but these experiences helped him in becoming a person who was fearless in the time of crisis.
In a 2014 interview, late film interviewer Tabassum, who hosted the Doordarshan talk show Phool Khile Hain Gulshan Gulshan, shared that Amitabh once saved her life when a fire broke out. Tabassum said that she had done many live stage shows with Bachchan but once, during a show in Mumbai, a fire broke out. â€œThis took place at Shanmukhananda Hall in Mumbai. I was sitting in a wheelchair and conducting the show as my leg was fractured. Suddenly, there was a fire and that caused a stampede. I started shouting for help. Nobody responded. They were all running for their lives. Then Amitji came. He took me to a safe place. Today, I am alive because of him,â€ she told Rediff.com.

"Being the wife of Bollywoodâ€™s â€˜Badshahâ€™ Shah Rukh Khan, who has a sea of fans outside his house almost every day and female fans waiting to catch a glimpse of him, is not easy. But Gauri Khan has been acing it for the past 32 years, since their marriage on October 25, 1991. Though, with some house rules, which Shah Rukh dare not mess with.
Just a couple of years after her marriage to Shah Rukh, Gauri, in an interview with Filmfare, made it loud and clear that Shah Rukh is into films and she is not. She even called acting the â€œworst professionâ€ in the world and said that no offer â€œwould be big enough to temptâ€ her to do films.

"For love or covering up a crime â€“ which of these would make people go the whole way? Thatâ€™s a thinker, right? Well, get ready to savour the real taste of the question as Abhishek Chaubeyâ€™s thriller series Killer Soup is set for release.
Netflix Indiaâ€™s first original series for the year 2024, the makers have unveiled Killer Soupâ€™s trailer, promising audiences a mazzedaar blend of genres. According to the trailer, the show is â€œvery, very loosely inspired by a news headline.â€"
"Aamir Khan and Reena Duttaâ€™s daughter Ira Khan is all set to tie the knot with her longtime boyfriend Nupur Shikhare on Wednesday. Ahead of their much-awaited wedding, the would-be bride and groom got a little goofy on social media as they showered love on each other.
Ira Khan posted a mirror selfie in which she was seen wearing a hairband which read, â€˜Bride to beâ€™. She captioned the photo, â€œReady!! I am going to wear this all day.â€ Later, she was seen stepping out to visit a salon in the same outfit, wearing the same hairband.

"Director Hansal Mehta, who worked with Manoj Bajpayee on the little-seen 2000 comedy drama Dil Pe Mat Le Yaar!!, said that the actor was very difficult to work with. In an interview, Hansal said that when he mentions it to Manoj now, the actor brushes it off, saying that he was very young at the time. â€œBut I was young too, I didnâ€™t know what was happening either,â€ Hansal said.
Appearing on a year-end roundtable organised by Cinema Express, Hansal said that he enjoys working with people he gets along with, and that an actor neednâ€™t be effusive to make an impression on him. Rajkumar Rao, for instance, was thrust upon him by director Anurag Kashyap and casting director Mukesh Chhabra, and now theyâ€™ve worked together on six projects. â€œItâ€™s about the connection that you feel. Manoj has major mood swings. We made Dil Pe Mat Le Yaar!! in 2000, and he was a pain in that film,â€ he said.

"Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan faced opposition from her family before they tied the knot on October 25, 1991. Gauriâ€™s family members, being â€˜orthodox Hindusâ€™ didnâ€™t want her to marry a Muslim. In fact, they thought that Shah Rukh was taking their â€˜naiveâ€™ daughter for a ride and was not serious about their relationship. Her brother Vikrant Chibber even wanted to â€˜murderâ€™ the actor every time he saw him.
In an old 1994 interview with Filmfare, Gauri revealed that Vikrant â€˜hatedâ€™ Shah Rukh and every time he saw him, he didnâ€™t like him. â€œHeâ€™s (Vikrant) a very cool, laid-back guy but whenever he saw Shah Rukh he saw red. He was very possessive about me and he had murder on his mind every time he caught Shah Rukh looking at me,â€ revealed Gauri.

"It is doubtful whether there is any other Indian superstar who leads as private a life as Tamil actor Ajith Kumar. Not only does he maintain a low profile, but his wife, renowned yesteryear actor Shalini, also prefers to value privacy and personal space, avoiding publicising these aspects of their lives.
The only glimpses of Ajithâ€™s personal life that his fans receive are when common people spot him in public places during his travels and share snapshots of or with him on social media. Recently, videos have surfaced online suggesting that â€œThalaâ€ is currently enjoying some personal time with his wife Shalini in Dubai.

In an interview, Shreyas said that heâ€™d never been hospitalised before in his life, and that the health emergency has made him realise that â€˜jaan hai toh jahaan hai (health is wealth).â€™ Shreyas was rushed to an Andheri hospital last month, where his heart stopped beating for a full 10 minutes.

"Back in the 1970s, actor-director Tinnu Anand had â€˜nervous attacksâ€™ because of Rishi Kapoor and Shashi Kapoor, while directing the film Duniya Meri Jeb Mein. The two actors, who played brothers in the film, were never present on set at the same time. In a recent interview, Anand narrated why it took him five years to complete the film. He also revealed why Shashi Kapoor got tagged as a â€˜taxiâ€™ actor.
In a recent interview with News18, Anand shared that when he cast Shashi in his film, the actor decided to give him only two hours per day as he was working five shifts a day. He said, â€œThe tragedy in that film was Shashi was already given the title of â€˜Taxi actorâ€™ by Raj Kapoor, â€˜Taxi hai Shashiâ€™. He did five shifts in a day but he didnâ€™t give me more than two hours. He used to come at 7 and by 9.30, he will pack up and leave for his next shift. One of the five shifts he used to do.â€

"Prabhas and Prithviraj Sukumaran-led Salaar benefitted from the extended New Yearâ€™s weekend, and delivered a blockbuster second Monday as it earned Rs 16.6 crore, 9.93% more than Sundayâ€™s Rs 15.1 crore. But as the audience returned to work on Tuesday, the filmâ€™s box office collection witnessed a significant dip.
On its second Tuesday, Salaar earned approximately Rs 7.50 crore, according to industry tracker Sacnilk. The filmâ€™s total domestic nett collection now stands at Rs 369.37 crore, beating Rajinikanthâ€™s Jailer, which ended its theatrical run with Rs 348.55 crore. The worldwide collection of Salaar till Monday was Rs 627.19 crore, surpassing both Vijayâ€™s Leo (Rs 605.9 crore) and Jailer (Rs 604.5 crore). However, the film is still trailing SS Rajamouliâ€™s Baahubali: The Beginning, which grossed Rs 650 crore worldwide in 2015."
"Dave Chappelle opens his latest Netflix special, The Dreamer, with a masterfully constructed joke, combining his penchant for autobiographical storytelling with his trademark laid-back delivery. Itâ€™s a pity, then, that he unleashes it in the service of a truly despicable punchline directed at, you guessed it, trans people. In a world populated by plenty of real villains â€” racists, corrupt politicians, warmongers â€” Chappelle has decided, for some obscure reason, to make the queer community his enemy. And itâ€™s truly tragic to watch one of the greatest comics of all time devote his talent to pettiness that would be viewed with pity even on a school playground.
In fact, watching him perform in recent years can immediately transform you into a middle-aged Indian schoolteacher. â€œThis boy had so much potential,â€ you think to yourself, as you shake your head in regret. But like a theoretical physicist helping the Nazis during World War II or a surgeon dedicating his life to stealing kidneys, Chappelle isnâ€™t exactly putting his skills to good use. And to top it all, he just canâ€™t seem to stop viewing himself as the wronged party in all of this."
"Days before the release of Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s Dunki, The Indian Express visited Gholpura village in Haryana-Punjab border, where every house has a member settled abroad. And most of them have taken the Dunki (or the illegal) route to Canada, US and England. One thing that most interviewees mentioned is how this perilous journey, which passes through some of the most hostile terrains in the world, wouldnâ€™t have been possible without the kindness of fellow travellers. Men and women from different walks of life, who would share their bread with fellow Indians, ensure that no one gets left behind.
In Hiraniâ€™s â€˜Dunkiâ€™, goodness of the common Indian propels the story forward. In a way, itâ€™s a Hirani construct â€” the unflinching faith (rather hope) in humanity that once defined films of Hrishikesh Mukherjee. Hirani, in the way only he can, throws light on the lives of a few Dunki travellers who migrate to London from Punjab. What follows is a rags-to-not-rags story, as Manu (Taapsee Pannu), a feisty girl from a Punjab village, travels illegally to England, walking through perilous jungles, dodging bullets of border police, escaping rape and persecution, with a little help from the adoring Hardy (Shah Rukh Khan), her â€˜bandaâ€™ (boyfriend). Embedded within it, however, is a story of red tape (and corruption) that surrounds every effort of these helpless men and women who want to access a better life in countries that will anyway use them for work that none of their citizens want to do. Manu and her friends find their way through the dehumanising labyrinth of forms, oral tests, fake marriages and cons, until a combination of persistence and Shah Rukh Khan, take them back to where it all started, the Punjab village, where the mustard field is always swaying to Pritamâ€™s melodies and lassi flows endlessly from jugs. The very structure of â€˜Dunkiâ€™, and indeed almost all of Hiraniâ€™s films, means it will always have the propensity to drift into melodrama, and plays with the kind of cliches that will pull at your heartstrings. But it almost always comes back to a more pointed center because of another quintessential Hirani ingredient â€” humour.

"A strong man whom the people regard as their ruler due to his righteousness faces numerous obstacles in his path; seeking solace and assistance, he turns to his best friend, a formidable figure known for strength, dominance and virtue; the latter assumes the role of commander, and together, they lead their army against the rulerâ€™s rivals who are determined to dethrone and eliminate him; the unbreakable bond between the ruler and his commander proves insurmountable, with their deep love for each other serving as their most powerful weapon.
If youâ€™ve watched both Mani Ratnamâ€™s Thalapathi and Prashanth Neelâ€™s Salaar: Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire, a retelling of Neelâ€™s 2014 film Ugramm, you may be uncertain about which movie is being discussed here. Donâ€™t worry; itâ€™s not your fault if you canâ€™t identify the film. In fact, from its core to the surface, Salaar is essentially a revamped version of the 1991 gangster film, which itself draws inspiration from the purported friendship between Karna and Duryodhana, characters from the Hindu epic Mahabharata.

"Sequels and franchises are the lifeblood of the movie business today. Most films are either a part of a franchise or could possibly get included in a â€˜cinematic universeâ€™ if they are successful. Even those films, that could be independent stories, leave enough room for a sequel, and while you might think that this is a new phenomenon for Indian films or something that we stole from our Western counterparts, the origin for franchises in India goes back to the 1940s. And much like today, this became a sure-shot way for a filmâ€™s success as soon as it was introduced. The first film to have a sequel was the 1935 film Hunterwali, starring the original stunt queen Fearless Nadia and the sequel, which came almost a decade later, revived her career.
In the 1930s, filmmaker Homi Wadia made a series of films which were heavily reliant on stunts and unlike now, the actors playing the lead roles were responsible for doing the action scenes themselves. Nadia, who earned the moniker â€˜Fearlessâ€™ and had performed stunts with lions in a closed cage, was the star of most of these films. In an interview with Girish Karnad in 1980, Homi had shared that the best era for stunt films was from 1935-1940. Mythological and historical films drew a lot of crowds in this era and when the audience was presented with action films where all the stunts were performed by an actress of Australian descent, they were hooked. Nadia, who was born as Mary, had moved to India with her parents during the First World War. And during the 1930s, she got established as the actress who could pull off any imaginable stunt. Her anglisiced Hindi attracted the viewers and her abandon towards performing the role of a warrior, while also managing to seduce her audience with her acting, gave her a unique position in the movies. The other Indian female actors were known for their demure and delicate ways but Nadia got love from the audience for being the exact opposite.

"Director Vetrimaaran has lately been making films about oppression. Be it Asuran, a bloody tale of a socially backward farmer, or his latest film, Viduthalai Part 1, an anti-establishment film about the violence meted out by police in tribal villages, the director has been making powerful statements with his movies. Speaking about the same, Vetrimaaran, at the roundtable of Cinema Express, credited director Pa Ranjith for the movement. He also shared his thoughts on social justice, and how an individual shouldnâ€™t shy away from standing up for the oppressed.
When asked whatâ€™s his view about people who can afford not to take a stand when it comes to issues that films like Viduthalai and Maamannan deal with, Vetrimaaran said, â€œImagine a couple is fighting on the road. And the man is beating the woman. If you just pass by without interfering because it is their issue, you are supporting the man. There is no one called a by-stander. If you are not taking a stand when it comes to the issue of oppression, it means you are standing by the oppressor.â€"
"When Siddharth Anandâ€™s Pathaan released in January 2023, it created history at the Indian box office. As Siddharth is now looking forward to the release of his next film, Fighter, the director took to social media and recalled the euphoria around Pathaan that â€œchanged everythingâ€ for him.
Siddharthâ€™s next film stars Hrithik Roshan, Deepika Padukone and Anil Kapoor in the lead roles. He took to Twitter and shared a note and recalled the â€œnervousness and anxietyâ€ he felt before the release of Pathaan. â€œPATHAAN, my film was releasing amidst a sea of forces against it. Something very weird called Boycott Bollywood was the phrase of the season. Hindi films were written off by naysayers. And then the day came. 25th January. I remember waking up at 7am. After going to bed at 3:30am post the cast & crew screening. Woke up feeling numb,â€ he shared.

"When Yash Joharâ€™s Dharma Productions produced the 1990 film Agneepath with Amitabh Bachchan in the lead role, the actor and the producer were both desperate for a hit. Yash Johar had been around in the film industry for a few decades by then and even his film production company had been around for almost a decade but they were yet to experience a big hit. But, despite all of that, Yash Johar had a jovial attitude and his sense of humour could always make people laugh.
In a recent interview with Rajshri Unplugged, actor Rohini Hattangadi recalled the time when she was working in Agneepath and producer Yash Johar took a dig at himself. Rohini recalled that in the process of trying to age a prop on the set, one of the crew members was hitting the prop with a stick and as they continued to do it, the prop looked a little older and shabby, as the scene demanded. During the process, a child actor asked Yash why this was being done and Yash, in his own style, answered, â€œBete, yeh meri pitayi kar rahe hain (It feels like they are hitting me).â€ Yash joked that the crew had first painted the prop and had then aged it so as a producer, both things were adding up in his cost.

â€œI felt so much warmth when I met her,â€ she shared with Pinkvilla and added, â€œI felt like I got the same amount of warmth and love that I was expecting and realised that she was also expecting the same. We had such a warm conversation. It was nice meeting her. I hardly had scenes with her, but every time I met her, there was so much love.â€

Directed by Vikas Bahl, the first season of the show also starred Ranvir Shorey, Girish Kulkarni, Mukul Chadda, Shonali Nagrani, Sonal Jha and Ashish Vidyarthi.

"Prabhas ended 2023 on a high note with his blockbuster film Salaar, which continued its impressive run into 2024. Released on December 22, Salaar witnessed a surge in box office collections on January 1. According to an early report by Sacnilk, posted at 7 pm, Salaar minted Rs 3.78 crore on Tuesday, bringing the domestic collection to Rs 365.4 crore.
The film made a spectacular start, earning Rs 90.7 crore on its opening day and maintaining a strong hold for the initial three days. Despite a subsequent decline during the first week, Salaar showed momentum during the New Year holiday, registering growth on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday with collections of Rs 12.55 crore, Rs 15.1 crore, and Rs 16.35 crore, respectively."
"Director Ram, best known for his debut film Katradhu Tamizh, is back with Yezhu Kadal Yezhu Malai which is reminiscent of his first movie. Here too an unkept but intriguing protagonist is in search of his lost love. However, unlike Katradhu Tamizh, which was a realistic tragedy, Yezhu Kadal Yezhu Malai comes across as a supernatural drama about a protagonist who is traversing across centuries to find his love.
Nivin Pauly is a vagabond in a tattered long coat, who seems to be more than what he comes across as. A fellow passenger (played by Soori), who reminds one of Karunasâ€™ character from Katradhu Tamizh, is in disbelief when he hears that Nivinâ€™s character has been living for 8822 years. It is up to the audience to decide whether the protagonist is sane or not. He also tells his love (played by Anjali) that when he first saw her, she was a queen."
"While the Instagram feeds of Bollywood actors are flooded with pictures from exotic New Year celebrations around the world, some A-listers chose the warmth of their homes to welcome 2024.

In the heartfelt note, Saira opened up about the enduring bond between Aamir and her late husband, legendary actor Dilip Kumar. She reflected on the unchanging presence of Aamir in their lives, emphasising his significance in their journey. She wrote, â€œWith each turn of the calendar, life continues to unfold, expand, and evolve. As years morph and time advances, a fresh perspective breathes new life into our existence. Amidst this perpetual change, there remains a constant: the presence of those who have shared our lifeâ€™s journey with us. For Sahib and me, Aamir has been this unchangeable presence.â€

Ankita got emotional as she recalled looking at a photo that she received after he passed away. Ankita has spoken about Sushant many times in the Bigg Boss house. The two dated for several years before parting ways.
The actor recalled, â€œWhen I saw him, I felt everything was over. So many films he watched, and everything was over. There was this one picture of him which was very bad,â€ she said as per Pinkvilla. She added, â€œIt looked like he was sleeping. I just kept looking at that picture and thought there was so much in his brain. I knew him very well. He must have had so much in his brain but all was vanished.

"Music maestro Ilaiyaraaja is known for speaking his mind without holding anything back. At times, it has led to severe backlash, but the veteran composer has never heeded any criticism. In a recent interview, on the sidelines of an art exhibition in Chennai, Raja expressed his thoughts about Mani Ratnamâ€™s Ponniyin Selvan films. It looks like the movies didnâ€™t impress the legend, who claimed that the films didnâ€™t give him the feel of the novel.
Ilaiyaraaja was one of the chief guests of late artist and illustrator Maniamâ€™s art exhibition in Chennai. Maniam is widely known for his illustrations for Kalkiâ€™s Ponniyin Selvan series, which was published as a series in Kalki magazine for about seven years. Speaking at the event, Ilaiyaraaja praised Maniamâ€™s work and how he and his friends were in love with the world. â€œMy friends including director Bharathiraja were huge fans of the books, and we used to take the book from a lending library nearby. We would only find the second part or the third part as the rest would be with someone else. Kalkiâ€™s words and his writings made me fly in my imagination. It was his and Maniamâ€™s illustrations of Kundhavai and Vandhiyathevan that made me dream about the world. And it was not the films. It didnâ€™t feel like the novel at all. Donâ€™t think I am finding faults with it. I have been affected by the book that much. I donâ€™t know how many times I have read the series.â€

"Actor-director Tinnu Anand recalled the financial fix he found himself in after Amitabh Bachchan was gravely injured on the set of Coolie, leading to a delay in the film Shahenshah, which Tinnu was directing. In an interview, he said that creditors were knocking on his door, and that after a tense few months, Amitabh assured him that he would complete the film.

Recalling the filmâ€™s troubled production, Tinnu said, â€œAmitabh fell ill, and he announced that he wonâ€™t be working in films again. He went to hospital, Breach Candy, indefinitely. He was in very, very bad shape after that accident. And the announcement came on Monday or Sunday, that Amitabh Bachchan will not work in films anymore.

"For Vignesh Shivan, in 2023, a big blow came in the form of a shelved film. The director was supposed to team up with actor Ajith Kumar for a movie. He went around town speaking about the project in interviews. However, due to reasons unknown, the film was dropped. What could have been a life-changing opportunity slipped out of his hands. And that could be the reason the director called 2023 a tough year. In an Instagram post, the Poda Podi director said that despite 2023 being a tough year, it was manageable because of his wife Nayanthara, and his sons, Uyir and Ulag.

"Shah Rukh Khan was appalled at Karan Joharâ€™s suggestions to wear tight jeans on the sets of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge and called Aditya Chopra to know who is the person telling him to do â€˜weirdâ€™ things. Karan, who has given his careerâ€™s biggest hits with Shah Rukh, recently narrated how he ended up being on a film set despite his mother Hiroo Joharâ€™s resistance and how eventually he got along with Shah Rukh, who gave him the confidence to direct his first film, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai.
Karan believes his becoming a film director was the doing of destiny as he was never â€œequipped to make a feature film.â€ He told Galatta Plus, â€œI hadnâ€™t gone to a film school, though my father produced films. Geographically, I lived in a different part of the city and I was far removed from the nepo kids. I never hung around with them a lot, barring Zoya (Akhtar), Farhan (Akhtar), Abhishek Bachchan and Shweta Bachchan. It was thanks to Adi (Aditya Chopra) that I got sucked into being on a film set.â€

"Actor Tinnu Anand, who also directed hit Amitabh Bachchan-starrers Kaalia and Shahenshah, recalled stories about working with the superstar. Looking back on the four years that it took to complete Kaalia, Tinnu narrated a story about his father, writer Inder Raj Anand, assuming control of the project for a scene that Amitabh was struggling with. The actor couldnâ€™t get himself to correctly deliver a line in Urdu, leading Tinnuâ€™s father to berate him in front of the entire crew.
Asked if he had any disagreements with the star, he said in an interview with News-18, â€œThe disagreements were mainly about dialogue. My father was the strength of Urdu; no one could argue with him. He was nowhere around set, but there was a party scene, in which Pran saab says, â€˜Youâ€™ve made a grand success of your life, but the road youâ€™ve taken is made of gold, and that will lead you straight to my prison, or to the gallows. Kaalia, that is your futureâ€™. And Kaalia says, â€˜Kya naza ki takleefon mein maza, jab maut na aaye jawaani mein. Kya lutf janaaza uthne ka, hargaam pe jab maatam na hogaâ€˜. I told my father when he wrote the line, I said, â€˜Dad, what does this mean?'â€

In an interview, he recalled horror stories from trial shows, as recently as the one he organised for his latest film, Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani.
In a humorous speech at the Galatta Plus year-end roundtable, Karan listed all the different kind of reactions that he has become accustomed to at preview screenings, and that theyâ€™re all useless because heâ€™s usually too stressed out at the time for honest feedback. â€œIâ€™m sorry to say, the hatred, sometimes very strongly, comes from within the industry,â€ he said.

"Director Jude Anthany Josephâ€™s Malayalam-language blockbuster 2018 failed to make it to the Oscars shortlist in the Best International Feature category. However, the filmmaker had a great time showcasing his film to the jury members. Going forward, he would want a film with better financial backing to be sent as Indiaâ€™s official entry for the Oscars or for the government of India to provide financial aid to the film for the Oscars campaign.
During a recent interview with Galatta Plus, Joseph shared how people in the US loved his film 2018, which was screened during the Oscar campaign. He said, â€œItâ€™s a wonderful journey at the Oscars.

"In a recent roundtable appearance, filmmaker Karan Johar said that he was advised against the â€˜Tum Kya Mileâ€™ song from his latest film, Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, because many felt that it would look archaic in an otherwise feminist film.

This prompted actor Rani Mukerji, who was also a part of the panel, to recall how inconsiderate Karan was to her when she was shooting a similar song in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna.
Karan said, â€œI had a chat with Alia, and I said, â€˜Listen, a lot of this is going to be difficult for youâ€™. And she said, â€˜But Iâ€™m dying to wear the chiffon saree, ask me first.'â€ Rani interjected, â€œTheyâ€™re so lucky that theyâ€™re being asked, in our time nobody asked us if weâ€™re feeling cold. â€˜Pehno saree, perform karoâ€™.â€ Karan recalled the shoot for the song â€˜Tumhi Dekho Naaâ€™, from the film Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, and said, â€œI was so crazy at that time, in -14 degrees, I said I want rain. So, there was a rain machine, but before it was reaching them, it was becoming ice. We had a health and safety department saying, â€˜Youâ€™ll kill themâ€™.â€

"Filmmaker Karan Johar dissected the online discourse that follows film releases, and said that many of these reactions are skewed. In an interview, Karan said that a lot of the negativity that he sees about a particular film is either generated by warring fan clubs, or people hungry to go viral after giving an attention-grabbing byte. He also admitted that in his capacity as a producer, he isnâ€™t above paying people to say good things about his films to alter perception about them.
Karan appeared on the Galatta Plus roundtable, where he said, â€œIf you notice, those people who do those vox pops outside cinemas, the ones who are walking up to talk are all wanting to say the most sensational things. The real audience has slipped out and gone away. But some people are giving loud reactions because they want to go viral. Now, to go viral, theyâ€™re f*****g us.â€

"Director Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Animal was one of the most controversial films of 2023. Though it earned nearly Rs 900 crore globally, the film found itself under the scanner for its perceived glorification of violence and toxic masculinity. But, in filmmaker Karan Joharâ€™s opinion, Animal was the â€˜bestâ€™ film of 2023. In an interview, Karan said that it â€˜aroused and engagedâ€™ him like no other film that he watched last year.
Appearing on the Galatta Plus pan-India roundtable, Karan admitted that he might get â€œdirty looksâ€ for saying it, but declared Animal to be â€˜the best film of the yearâ€™. He said, â€œI loved Animal for its front-footed, absolutely conviction-based narrative, breaking grammar, breaking myths and breaking everything that you conform to in mainstream cinema.â€

"As New Yearâ€™s festivities continued on Monday, director Prashanth Neelâ€™s Salaar made a leap towards the Rs 400 crore mark in the domestic market. Starring Prabhas and Prithviraj Sukumaran, the film was witnessing a decline in its collections during the weekdays, but it got back on track during the lucrative New Yearâ€™s weekend.
Salaarâ€™s box office collection on Day 11 stood at Rs 15.5 crore, as per industry tracker Sacnilk. This brought the filmâ€™s total nett collection in India to Rs 360.77 crore. The Telugu version of the film continued to contribute the largest share to the total earnings, with an occupancy of 48.75%. After Telugu, the Hindi version of the film is the highest contributor with 28.03% occupancy on Monday. This is followed by 20.26% Tamil occupancy and 16.32% Malayalam occupancy.

"Even as director Prashanth Neelâ€™s Prabhas-starrer Salaar: Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire continues to dominate the domestic market, director Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s comedy-drama Dunki remained resilient despite mixed reviews. The movie continued to record respectable daily box office figures, even on weekdays, highlighting Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s influence in the domestic market.
On its 12th day in theatres, coinciding with New Yearâ€™s, Dunki generated about Rs 9.25 crore nett in India. Although this figure is notably lower than SRKâ€™s previous film Jawan, which earned Rs 16.25 crore on its second Monday, it surpasses his first blockbuster of the year, Pathaan (Rs 8.55 crore), which ultimately grossed Rs 1,000 crore worldwide.

"Though Prashanth Neelâ€™s Salaar: Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire outperformed Atlee Kumarâ€™s Jawan as the highest-grossing opener of 2023, it appears that the Prabhas film may not completely overshadow Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s actioner in terms of overall box office earnings, given the evident advantage for SRK when comparing the daily figures of both movies.
Nevertheless, Salaar continues to maintain its dominance in the domestic market, keeping Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s Dunki at a considerable distance. Even on the first day of this year, which also signifies the second Monday of the filmâ€™s theatrical run, Salaar continues to perform well.

"A day after â€œThalapathyâ€ Vijay unveiled the first look poster of his upcoming movie and revealed its title as The Greatest of All Time (The GOAT), the star has released another poster from the movie, which is sure to up the anticipation surrounding the film by multiple folds.
The latest poster features two Vijays on a motorcycle, firing guns at their rivals. The Vijay driving the bike appears older and resolute, while the one on the pillion seems computer-generated, suggesting that The GOAT might be a sci-fi film. The imageâ€™s setting reinforces this notion, diverging from typical surroundings. In the scene, the older Vijay wields a pistol, while the younger one looks directly at the camera, shooting with a machine gun."

Last week, the 52-year-old actor had hinted at his return to the show after he shared an Instagram Story with his co-star Emma Laird. As he continues to recover, Renner spoke with Andy Cohen and Anderson Cooper during their CNN New Yearâ€™s Eve special.

"Shah Rukh Khan, having delivered two mega blockbusters, Jawan and Pathaan, took the big screen by storm with his highly anticipated third film, Dunki. Despite high expectations, the movie experienced a slow start at the box office due to underwhelming response from the audience. In the last three days, the filmâ€™s collection remained in single digits, but a notable surge was observed on Sunday, attributed in part to the New Year holiday, resulting in a Rs 12 crore box office intake. This has brought the filmâ€™s total domestic collection to Rs 188.22 crore, as reported by Sacnilk.
During the first week of its release, Dunki garnered slightly over Rs 160 crore. While it encountered a 14 per cent decline in collections on Friday, with earnings of Rs 7 crore, the weekend and the New Year holiday saw a substantial 28 percent growth on Saturday, bringing in Rs 9 crore. The upward trend continued on Sunday.

"Faysal Quraishi, one of Pakistanâ€™s top actors and producers, has advocated for the release of Indian films in the country to revive the local cinema exhibition sector.
Quraishi, who has starred in several hit serials and also produced many blockbuster series, said Pakistan needed to lift the ban on screening of Indian films to survive and grow.
â€œBeing a Pakistani, Iâ€™m very patriotic. But if you have to run Pakistani cinemas, itâ€™s important that you exhibit Indian films. Iâ€™m being very selfish. But I know the audience in Pakistan wants to watch Indian films. You canâ€™t enforce your will on them. Let us work to improve relations,â€ he said in an interview with a local channel.

There has been a complete ban on screening of Indian films in cinema houses in Pakistan since late 2019 but movie buffs can easily watch these movies on different streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, which are legal and even others which are accessible through VPN services.

Faysal Quraishi
If there was no ban on Indian films in Pakistan, Faysal Quraishi said the Pakistan film industry would have been earning around Rs 6,000 to 7,000 million annually from the entertainment business, including screening of Pakistani content on Indian streaming portals and some channels.
â€œOur movies and serials were being shown on their online portals and people went to the cinemas as well to watch Indian films and it brought in valuable revenue for our industry. It is funny we tend to shut down our avenues of revenue,â€ he said.
Faysal Quraishi said he had come to the conclusion that until Indian films were allowed to be screened in Pakistani cinemas its industry could not grow.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œPeople need new and exciting content to attract them to the cinemas and for that, not only do we need to improve our content and business models but also have no ban on screening of Indian movies. This would also reopen our content on streaming portals,â€ he added.
Quraishi said the Pakistan entertainment industry can be revived and it was necessary for Pakistani content to be shown on streaming portals.
â€œIt is time we started producing content of such a level that we can even hit the international streaming platforms,â€ he said.

"One must focus on leading a fitter life and not a life with â€œfiltersâ€ inspired by film stars, said actor Akshay Kumar on Sunday in Prime Minister Narendra Modiâ€™s monthly radio programme Mann Ki Baat.
The actor was one of the many personalities from different walks of life who shared their tips on fitness in the 108th episode of the broadcast, the last for the year 2023.

â€œYou all know Iâ€™m passionate about fitness, but Iâ€™m even more passionate about staying fit the natural way. What I like more than fancy gyms is swimming, playing badminton, climbing stairs, exercising with â€˜mudgarâ€™, eating good healthy foodâ€¦
â€œChange your lifestyle on the advice of doctors and not by looking at some film starâ€™s body. Actors are often not what they appear on screen. Many types of filters and special effects are used and after seeing them, we start using shortcuts to change our body,â€ the actor said.
Akshay also cautioned the listeners about taking shortcuts in their fitness journey.

â€œNowadays, many people take steroids and go for these six packs and eight packs. Friends, with such shortcuts the body swells from outside but remains hollow from inside. Remember that shortcuts can cut your life short. You need long-lasting fitness, not shortcutsâ€¦
â€œLike, I believe pure ghee, if eaten in the right quantity, is beneficial for us. But I see many boys and girls do not eat ghee because they fear they might become fat. It is very important for us to know what is good and what is bad for our fitness,â€ he added.
The actor likened fitness to â€œdevotionâ€.

â€œIt shouldnâ€™t be like instant coffee or two-minutes noodles. In this new year, promise yourself no chemicals, no shortcut, exercise, yoga, good food, sleeping on time, some meditation and most importantly, happily accept how you look. After today, donâ€™t live a filter life, live a fitter life,â€ Akshay said.
During the broadcast of Mann Ki Baat, Isha Foundation founder Sadhguru, Indian Womenâ€™s Cricket Team Captain Harmanpreet Kaur and chess legend Vishwanathan Anand also shared their fitness tips.

"US singer, dancer and American Idol star Paula Abdul filed a lawsuit accusing British television executive Nigel Lythgoe of sexually assaulting her when they worked together on two popular talent shows, according to court documents.
Abdul, who rose to fame as a chart-topping singer in the late 1980s, alleged in a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Friday that Lythgoe sexually assaulted her in an elevator during the early seasons of TV singing competition series American Idol.
Lythgoe, the producer of several hit television talent competitions, allegedly groped Abdulâ€™s breasts and genitals, among other unwanted physical contact in a hotel elevator after a day of auditions for American Idol. Abdul tried to push him away and ran as soon as the elevator doors opened, court documents said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Reuters was not immediately able to reach Abdul or Lythgoe for comment. Lythogoe denied the allegations, according to TMZ.
â€œFor more than two decades, Paula and I have interacted as dear â€“ and entirely platonic â€“ friends and colleagues,â€ he told TMZ. â€œYesterday, however, out of the blue, I learned of these claims in the press and I want to be clear: not only are they false, they are deeply offensive to me and to everything I stand for.â€
According to court documents, Abdul immediately reported the assault by Lythgoe, an American Idol producer at the time, to her representatives but did not take action for fear of losing her job, the lawsuit said.
Moreover, Abdulâ€™s contracts prohibited her from speaking out, the lawsuit said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Another alleged assault took place years later when Abdul worked as a judge on So You Think You Can Dance, according to court documents. The star, 61, enjoyed renewed popularity in the early 2000s starring as a judge on talent TV series.
The lawsuit alleges Lythgoe, 74, assaulted her on the couch of his Los Angeles home after a work dinner. Abdul again firmly rejected him and â€œimmediately left Lythgoeâ€™s home,â€ court documents said.
In the lawsuit, Abdul levels other allegations at the entertainment industry mogul, including that Lythgoe once called to taunt her and said it had been â€œseven years and the statute of limitations had runâ€ on the alleged assaults.
The lawsuit alleged that the star also witnessed Lythgoe assault one of her assistants on So You Think You Can Dance.

The lawsuit was submitted days before the Dec. 31 filing deadline established under the Californiaâ€™s Sexual Abuse and Cover-Up Accountability Act. The legislation allows individuals to bring certain sexual abuse lawsuits that would otherwise have fallen outside the statute of limitations.

"The Rajkumar Hirani-directed Dunki, starring Shah Rukh Khan and Taapsee Pannu in the lead roles and Vicky Kaushal in an extended cameo, has witnessed a mixed response amongst the audience. This lukewarm feedback from the audience has also led to the movie not earning exceptionally well at the box office. However, on its 10th day on Saturday, the film saw a slight jump from Friday. According to the industry tracker Sacnilk, Dunki earned around Rs 7 crore on Friday, and its early estimates for Saturday (day 10) stand at Rs 9. 25 crore in all languages combined. With this, the total collection of Dunki stands at Rs 176.47 crore.
Dunki is SRKâ€™s third film in 2023, and compared to his Jawan and Pathaan, Dunkiâ€™s stint at the box office has been very disappointing. The film has gotten mixed reviews. The Indian Express gave the movie one and a half stars and called this Shah Rukh Khan and Rajkumar Hirani collaboration a crashing bore. Many fans also gave the film a so-so review on social media. As per Red Chillies Entertainment, the worldwide box office collection of Dunki stands at Rs 340.10 crore.

Both Jawan and Pathaan earned double digits on their 10th day and while the previous two films of Shah Rukh Khan continue to be counted among the highest-grossers of 2023, Dunki would not make the cut.
On the work front, Shah Rukh Khan might be seen making a guest appearance in daughter Suhana Khanâ€™s next film in 2024. Other than that, he also has Tiger vs Pathaan which is slated to release in 2026.

"Prabhas-starrer Salaar: Cease Fire â€“ Part 1 experienced a record-breaking opening at the box office, but saw a gradual decline in its collections during the first week of release. According to industry tracker Sacnilk, the film amassed Rs 12.50 crore on Saturday, bringing its total domestic earnings to Rs 329.62 crore in India over nine days.
The filmâ€™s box office trajectory witnessed a consistent downturn during its first week. Salaar started strong with a Rs 90.7 crore opening day, followed by Rs 56.35 crore on Saturday and Rs 62.05 crore on Sunday. By the end of its first week, the film had accumulated a collection of Rs 308 crore. However, it rebounded during the second weekend, showing a slight growth on Saturday with an additional Rs 12.50 crore. Further growth is anticipated over the next two days, especially with the New Year holiday.
Salaar boasted a 38.01 percent Telugu occupancy on Saturday, complemented by an impressive 22.84 percent Hindi occupancy. Additionally, the film recorded 15.97 percent Kannada occupancy, 18.54 percent Tamil occupancy, and 19.92 percent Malayalam occupancy.

In the movie, Prabhas portrayed the titular character Salaar. Prithviraj Sukumaran, Shruti Haasan, and Jagapathi Babu play supporting roles in the film. Produced by Vijay Kiragandur under Hombale Films and directed by KGF fame Prashanth Neel, the movie faced a box office clash with Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Dunki, which has accumulated Rs 176.47 crore in India to date. Despite the tough competition, the Prabhas-starrer has demonstrated strong performance at the box office."
"The last few years brought the film industry to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic. Movies got pushed, actors itched to return to the silver screens and theatre owners waited for people to queue up at the ticket counters. Come 2023, normalcy was resumed â€” audiences crowded cinema halls and even bought movie tickets at hefty prices (tickets for Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Pathaan sold for Rs 2100 at some places) to satiate their appetite for big-screen entertainment. Actors, who were long considered as the most reliable ones to fill seats, made the most of the audienceâ€™s mood and reclaimed their status as box office stars, thus saving the sinking boat of the Indian movie marketplace.
Shah Rukh Khan propelled Siddharth Anandâ€™s Pathaan and Atleeâ€™s Jawan to financial heights, while Ranbir Kapoor delivered back-to-back hits with Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar and Animal. The Deols â€“ Dharmendra, Sunny and Bobby â€“ reclaimed the spotlight and gave three hits individually with Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, Gadar 2 and Animal.

"Amid the mixed response that his latest film, Dunki, has been receiving, director Rajkumar Hirani can take pride in his decision to cast Vicky Kaushal in a supporting role. Even the filmâ€™s detractors have agreed that Vickyâ€™s performance was one of Dunkiâ€™s highlights. But did you know that the role of Sukhi landed in Vickyâ€™s lap by chance, and that Hirani originally intended to cast newcomers for all the side characters, including Sukhi?
Reflecting on an early conversation with Dunkiâ€™s stunt director and Vickyâ€™s father, Sham Kaushal, Hirani told NDTV, â€œAs we were chatting, the topic of casting came up. When he asked about the ideal boy for the role of Sukhi, I mentioned, â€˜A boy like Vicky would be perfectâ€™. However, I made it clear that I wouldnâ€™t offer him the role because itâ€™s a small role. Now heâ€™s doing lead roles, so I wouldnâ€™t offer it to him. Sham didnâ€™t say anything.â€

She said that as a culture, Indians are accustomed to thinking that â€˜papa knows bestâ€™, and that same mentality translates into our cinema.
At a roundtable discussion organised by Zoom Entertainment, her co-panelist, Amruta Subhash, spoke highly about action films, and said that they are very difficult to execute because thereâ€™s so much that could go wrong. Ratna wasnâ€™t as forgiving. She said, â€œI think itâ€™s a trend that has been foisted upon us, and has been encouraged, over many, many decades. And itâ€™s not something thatâ€™ll go away. Itâ€™ll reinvent itself in different ways. There is a large audience that is keen on seeing that. They sublimate what they are seeing in their lives through characters of this type, and until our society changes, I donâ€™t think these kind of films changing. Theyâ€™ll keep coming back.â€

"Despite facing tough competition at the box office from director Prashanth Neelâ€™s Prabhas-starrer Salaar: Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire, director Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s Dunki, starring Shah Rukh Khan in the lead role, has been showcasing a commendable performance, and has so far earned a global gross of over Rs 340 crore in just nine days.
Centred around the illegal immigration technique known as â€˜donkey flightâ€™, the film has sparked significant discussions on the topic since its release. A recent incident involving a charter plane carrying 276 passengers â€” mostly Indians â€” being grounded in France for four days due to suspected human trafficking, before being sent back to Mumbai, has once again brought attention to the subject.

Not a single month goes by without reports of people crossing borders in such ways. Since we are more aware of this now, it immediately captures our attention when it makes the news.â€

â€œIn Dunki, the flashback is set in 1995. Nowadays, several countries provide Indians with visas upon arrival. So the method to illegally immigrate has changed. In the past, people used to physically cross borders from India to Pakistan, then to Afghanistan, followed by Turkey. From there, they would travel by boat to Greece, then move on to Italy and then France. This was one of the donkey routes. Sometimes people also went through Russia,â€ he explained.

Mentioning that the 276 passengers grounded in France were en route to Nicaragua â€” a country that grants Indian passport holders visas on arrival â€” Hirani remarked, â€œOnce they reach there, they would then cross borders and go to Europe.â€ He added, â€œBut if you go to Punjab and say â€˜Dunki lagani haiâ€™ (Want to commute via the donkey route), they will immediately understand what you mean. Everyone in that state knows what it signifies.â€
Hirani said that while researching the subject, he spoke to people who either knew somebody whoâ€™d â€˜done the dunkiâ€™, or was in the process of doing it themselves. He spoke to a man from Punjab who was in Mexico, and was sure that heâ€™d made it across the border in a few months.

"Actor Ratna Pathak Shah expressed appreciation for filmmakers of today, and said that in her time, most directors had no idea what they were doing. Ratna participated in a roundtable discussion for Zoom Entertainment, which also included actors Sobhita Dhulipala, Amruta Subhash and Rajshri Deshpande, each of whom has worked with Anurag Kashyap. As they were appreciating how he handles actors on his sets, Ratna said that she didnâ€™t have the same sort of freeing experience with the filmmakers she worked with earlier in her career.
She said, â€œI have come from a time where directors really did not know. You sat around set for hours, waiting for a scene to come, waiting for things to get organised, waiting for a prop which was written on the first page of the scene but has still not come. Every little thing was a problem. And in the meantime, they would discuss, â€˜Iski picture kaisi chali? Lunch mein kya ayega? Aaj toh sarson ka saag manga lete hain (How did that guyâ€™s film do? Whatâ€™s for lunch?). Theyâ€™d have a long, two-hour discussion on what weâ€™re going to eat. They werenâ€™t bothered about the scene.â€

"The year 2023 was significant for both Bollywood and Ayushmann Khurrana, and the actor recently said that the success of his film Dream Girl 2, along with several other mid-budget movies, proved that audiences are hungry for new storytelling on the big screen after a disappointing 2022. Backing his viewpoint with examples like his Dream Girl 2, Akshay Kumarâ€™s OMG 2 and Sunny Deolâ€™s Gadar 2, Khurrana told Variety, â€œThere was a conspiracy theory, maybe a year back, that Indian audiences [were] only looking for spectacles or larger-than-life films, but this year, a lot of films [like the aforementioned ones], which were not really big budget but mid-budget, did really well.â€

â€œDream Girl 2 did well; so did OMG 2, and Gadar 2 was technically also a mid-budget film. That norm has been broken; that conspiracy theory has been proven wrong,â€ he added.

"Actor Sunny Deol spoke about the spectacular year that his family has had, both professionally and personally. In an interview, he said that his brother, Bobby Deol, never got his due, and that he is pleased to see him being appreciated for his performance in the record-breaking hit, Animal. Sunny himself delivered the biggest hit of his career, Gadar 2, earlier this year. And before that, their father, Dharmendra, stole the show in Karan Joharâ€™s Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahani.
Speaking to NDTV, Sunny said that it was Prakash Jhaâ€™s crime series, Aashram, that changed Bobbyâ€™s career. The actor had been out of action for several years before restarting his acting journey in 2018. Released on MX-Player, Aashram is considered to be one of the most-watched Indian streaming shows of all time. Sunny said, â€œIâ€™m so, so happy for him. Itâ€™s high time it happened. I can say now, people were not fair to him. I canâ€™t talk about myself, but I can talk about him. Theyâ€™ll call him a â€˜sweet boyâ€™, but nobody is doing anything. They know his capacity, they know his persona, but nobody let it happen.â€

"Days after heavy rains wreaked havoc in the Tamil Nadu districts of Thoothukudi (Tuticorin) and Nellai (Tirunelveli), leading to significant floods that impacted numerous lives, Tamil actor â€œThalapathyâ€ Vijay stepped forward to assist those in distress and distributed relief materials to families hit by the floods.
Last week, relentless showers had battered the southern districts of Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Tenkasi and Kanyakumari, bringing regular life to a halt and resulting in widespread inundation."
"The release of Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Dunki and Prabhasâ€™ Salaar, one day apart from each other, was deemed as the biggest box office clash of the year. The fans of both the actors indulged in a war of words on social media and there was also a fight for the screens for both the films. Recently, Salaar director Prashanth Neel commented on the big clash. As per him, the clash was only in the mind of the fans as actors or directors â€œare not here to compete among ourselvesâ€.
Speaking to Pinkvilla, Neel said, â€œWhat happens with cinema is you root for your heroes and the emotions get the better of you. It might be that way for the fans but with us, we are not trying to compete with one another. We are both surviving together. I donâ€™t advocate being a part of something like that. Itâ€™s nasty is what I heard. I really wish it didnâ€™t come down to something like that because both the stars are huge in Indian cinema and they deserve the respect they have accumulated over all these years.â€

The filmmaker believes that such an environment â€œis not good for cinemaâ€. But since â€œthereâ€™s no way to control something like that, you would rather ignore it. You just let it pass.â€ While Dunki was released in the theatres on December 21, Salaar arrived on December 22. But there was a huge difference between the opening box office collection of both. Salaar earned Rs 90.7 crore and Dunki took an opening of Rs 29.2 crore.
Neel said, â€œIt is not a war between Dunki and Salaar. I donâ€™t think either the makers of Dunki or Salaar think like that. We are here to survive and impress the audience. We are not here to compete among ourselves. This is not a cricket match.â€ The filmmaker also understands the feelings of the fans as he said that they are just â€œpossessiveâ€ about their favourite star.
The director was also asked about the â€˜misconstruction of numbersâ€™ referring to the allegations that box office numbers of the films that are released for public consumption might not be correct. â€œIf this was a solo release, I donâ€™t think this would have come up,â€ Prashanth said. He further added that he doesnâ€™t take the audience to be foolish and believes that they can see through such things. He said, â€œMisrepresentation and all of these things are heresy. You want to hear more negatives than positives.â€

"Weeks after BTSâ€™ RM and V began their mandatory military service, photos of the two donning military uniforms have surfaced on social media, much to the delight of their fans. In the photos, the two can be seen sitting in a disciplined manner, but the fans are finding these photos extremely charming.
Seeing the photos, BTS fans couldnâ€™t contain their excitement and started expressing their admiration for the icons. â€œThey look so handsome in their uniforms. I know their families and country are proud of them. I am not from South Korea, and I am very proud of them,â€ one user wrote.
â€œOur men are so handsome and charismatic. They have always been true role models we want to follow, and now in the military too. So proud of them. Looking forward to seeing the pictures of all seven ðŸ’œ,â€ another Twitterati mentioned.

Meanwhile, on the occasion of his 28th birthday on Saturday, BTSâ€™ V released a new song titled â€œWherever U Râ€, marking his first-ever collaboration with American singer UMI. The lyrical video of the song, shared by UMI on her official YouTube channel, has already garnered significant attention.

Before embarking on their military duties, RM and V took a moment to express their feelings in heartfelt letters to their devoted fandom, known as the ARMY. Urging their fans not to feel saddened by their departure, the duo encouraged them to look forward to the groupâ€™s eventual reunion.
â€œI think I will miss you so much. Actually, Iâ€™m really sad that I canâ€™t make happy memories with my ARMY for the time being, so itâ€™s okay if I take one out, but itâ€™s the hardest not to see the ARMY. Iâ€™II be back after 18 months of being healthy, so take care of your ARMY and if youâ€™re looking for something to be happy about every day, cheers,â€ V noted.

â€œAfter living diligently in our own lives and individual places, smiling wide when we return, hoping that we will be us, who are more frank, and full of heart and soul it is a â€˜goodbye for a little whileâ€™ goodbye! When I come back, I will greet you again by saying â€˜hiâ€™,â€ he noted while concluding a long note.

Three other BTS members, Jin, J-Hope, and Suga, have already been fulfilling their military obligations for several months. The entire seven-member group plans to come together again in 2025, once each member completes their service.
BTS made its debut in June 2013 and within a few years, became a worldwide sensation with its catchy hits and social campaigns that the group said was aimed at empowering the youth. The meteoric rise of the group was accompanied by a growing fandom and international attention that inspired other artistes in the Korean entertainment industry."
"Ankita Lokhande and husband Vicky Jain entered the Bigg Boss house together but it seems that their strategy inside the house is causing a lot of friction in their personal life. The couple is often seeing arguing over various issues but recently, Ankita brought up divorce in another argument. In an earlier fight too, Ankita had spoken about them filing for divorce.
Here, Ankita was defending Munawar Faruqui in a mock legal case and Vicky was playing the role of the opposition. During the show, when the couple started arguing, Bigg Boss asked Vicky to let Ankita play. While Ankita thanked Bigg Boss, Vicky triggered her by saying, â€œBigg Boss is trying to say that start playing your game.â€. When Bigg Boss clarified himself by saying that he wants Ankita to discuss the strategy with Munawar, Vicky continued to pass comments.
When Ankita couldnâ€™t hold back any longer, she fired at Vicky and said, â€œAap mere saath aisa mat khijiye kyunki humari hi na ladai ho jaye, humara divorce case na chalu ho jaye (Donâ€™t do this with me otherwise we might end up fighting and our divorce proceedings will begin).â€

Earlier, Ankita had brought up the matter of divorce during an argument with Vicky. It all started when he had presented himself as a suffering man in a conversation with Ayesha Khan. Recently, during one of the episodes, it had appeared that Vicky tried to slap Ankita. This had created quite an uproar on social media. Ankitaâ€™s mother Vandana Pandir Lokhande reacted to this and spoke to the paparazzi. She said, â€œBilkul galat tha woh. Kyun ki main janti hu Vicky ko. Mere saath mein rehte hai woh. Toh I know them very well. Yeh bilkul galat hai. Aisa kuch bhi nahin tha. Kyunki woh bahut loving couple hai aur unko ek dusre ko pyar karne wala mila hai (This is absolutely wrong.

"Indian wicketkeeper-batsman KL Rahul credits his wife and Bollywood actor, Athiya Shetty for keeping him motivated to become a better version of himself. In a recent chat, the cricketer opened up about the superstition she has, just like her father Suneil Shetty, when he is playing. He also revealed how Athiya reacted on his injury which happened when he was playing an IPL match. The cricketerâ€™s tendon â€˜ripped apartâ€™ from his quadricep and he had to go under the knife to recover.
Recalling his recovery period, when he had to be away from the cricket ground due to his thigh injury, Rahul told Star Sports, â€œShe was more frustrated and angry than I was. I found myself trying to keep her calm as it was the first time she was seeing me go through something like this.â€ However, the Mubarakan actor gave a â€œlot of loveâ€ to her husband while he was recovering. Rahul added, â€œIt was tough for both of us but it also gave us time that we needed together. She gave me a lot of love.â€

"2023 was a comparatively better year for Ratna Pathak Shah, as the veteran actor was featured in three web series and one film. She kicked off 2023 with the crime drama series Trial by Fire and also took on the lead role in the comedy series Happy Family: Conditions Apply. Following that, she appeared in the mystery thriller show Charlie Chopra & The Mystery Of Solang Valley and concluded the year with the road adventure film Dhak Dhak.
Though she commenced her silver screen journey with Shyam Benegalâ€™s classic satirical comedy Mandi (1983), Ratna became more actively involved in cinema in the last decade or so. However, in the past few years, she has been gracing screens with unconventional and nuanced characters, captivating audiences.

Meanwhile, she recently opened up about the initial days of her career and the reasons behind her delayed success. Reflecting on her debut in Mandi, she humorously mentioned, â€œIf you blinked for two and a half minutes while watching it, you would miss me. I was just hanging around there, frankly. Naseer and I had just gotten married, and he had to go off for a shoot. Shyam asked me to come along with him, and I did. So, I was just a total hanger-on. I have been a bloody hanger-on for years,â€ she recalled during a conversation with Zoom TV.

Reminiscing about her role in Ketan Mehtaâ€™s Mirch Masala, Ratna mentioned that her part was very miniscule. She acknowledged that these filmmakers, unfortunately, didnâ€™t know how she could fit in. â€œI have to admit, I wasnâ€™t very good. I didnâ€™t even have a particularly unusual face like Smita (Patil) or Shabana (Azmi). They sort of changed the way you look at women on screen. Mine (face) was neither here nor there. So, I am not surprised that they (the filmmakers) didnâ€™t imagine that I could do more than whatever I did,â€ she explained.

She also reminisced about working with Ketan Mehta on a play titled The Lesson, penned by French-Romanian playwright EugÃ¨ne Ionesco, at the age of 18 when she had just started her career. â€œI was even more of an idiot than I was later. I donâ€™t think I understood anything. Whatever Ketan said, I sort of tried to doâ€¦â€
Emphasising that that era was exceptional, Ratna mentioned she was always observing their works. â€œIt was a very useful experience for me. I learned a great deal watching these people work. I was a pretty dumb person back then so I was trying to soak in everything I could get. Nobody starts out right. You start at Point A, and if you remain there, you are an idiot. But if you progress from Point A to B, C, and D, that means you did some work,â€ she added.

"Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s latest release Dunki, starring Shah Rukh Khan, released a few days ago and has been competing against Prabhas-starrer Salaar for a few days now. The box office collections of both these films are being compared to one another and Hirani has now said that more than the collections, one should speak about the content of the film.
In an interview with ANI, Hirani spoke about the impact that the publicity of box office collections have on audience. â€œI feel itâ€™s temporary and it is possible that people get influenced. A person can hear something negative and it is possible that he wonâ€™t go. It does have a little impact but in the longer run, that person will see it. If not here (theatre), then may be on OTT or satellite and then his love will stay with the film,â€ he said,
He added, â€œI still feel that a barometer to judge a film should beâ€¦ jo debate honi chahiye wo paiso se zyada film ki honi chahiye, film ke content se hone lagi hai. Thoda sa hum ye paiso se karne lage hai, ye tha nahi pehle, ye thoda sa badh gaya hai abhi. (The debate around a film should be more about its content than the money. These days we focus a little more on money.) Earlier, we used to go for a film innocently. We used to talk about the film but now the discussion around numbers has increased.â€

Dunki stars Shah Rukh Khan in the lead role where he is helping out his friends to get to London via an illegal route. This film is Shah Rukhâ€™s third release this year after blockbuster action-entertainers Pathaan and Jawan.
Calling the actor â€˜braveâ€™, Rajkumar said that Shah Rukh was invested in the film ever since he first heard about it. â€œWhen you make a film, you make it because you like the story and Shah Rukh has been involved in the story from its inception. From the time I showed him the photograph of the plane, he was very curious. He is a brave actor and every actor wants to try something different. He did action films, so he wouldnâ€™t want to keep doing that. He was very involved, very happy with the story,â€ he said.
The filmmaker also shared how he has been wanting to work with the actor for several years now and Dunki gave him the chance. Rajkumar described working with Shah Rukh as a lot of fun and added that he is â€œgreat man who showers love on everyone.â€
The directorâ€™s previous films including Sanju, PK, and 3 Idiots were celebrated for their box office collections.

In an interview with The Free Press Journal, Madhu called Nick and Priyanka a â€œbefitting match.â€ She said, â€œThrough my daughter Priyanka, I am earning double the benefit of what I had given to my parents and in-laws. Priyanka has imbibed one thing from us i.e. family support is of utmost importance. She has seen her father taking care of them when I was away in an emergency.

"In stark contrast to the clarity of 2022, this year defies easy categorization. While the previous year unequivocally silenced discussions about the demise of theaters, showcasing a diverse range of blockbusters from intimate family dramas like Thiruchitrambalam to the pan-Indian spectacle of KGF Chapter 2, 2023 took a more nuanced turn. The triumphant return of Mani Ratnam with the film adaptation of Ponniyin Selvan and the success of Kamal Haasanâ€™s Vikram stood out. However, the real victor was Karthi, not the usual superstars, with three hits that reverberated across the industry. However, uncertainty lingers around the progress card of 2023, which is marked by both the highest number of releases and notable failures among big-budget films. To decode the nuances of the past year, Indian Express engaged in discussions with industry experts producer-distributor G Dhananjeyan, Vetri Theatre owner Rakesh Gowthaman, and film trade analyst Ramesh Bala.

Stars Dimmed?
In 2022, stars like PS 1, Vikram, and Vendhu Thanindhathu Kaadu scored dual victories as they emerged as blockbusters and critical favorites. However, this time, the stars fell short of expectations. Karthi, riding high on the successes of Sardar, Komban, and PS 1, faced a setback with Japan, emerging as one of the yearâ€™s biggest disappointments. Mani Ratnamâ€™s PS 2 also failed to captivate audiences like the first part. Despite a promising start with Vijayâ€™s Varisu and Ajithâ€™s Thunivu, the hits became sporadic, as noted by Rakesh Gowthaman. â€œLeo, Jailer, and Varisu were exceptions; mid-level and small-budget films struggled. After Thunivu and Varisu, the next hit, Viduthalai: Part 1, arrived in March. The lull continued, with movies like Dada having modest success. Ponniyin Selvan 2, expected to be a blockbuster, did not match the hype, resulting in a lackluster summer. Hits like Maamannan, Maaveeran, Jailer, and Leo offered some relief, but overall, 2023 proved middling. Even the much-anticipated Maaveeran fell short of Sivakarthikeyanâ€™s best. Dhanush, Karthi, and Suriya didnâ€™t make a significant impact.â€
ADVERTISEMENT
Contrary to this perspective, Dhananjeyan contends that 2023 was far from a dismal year for Tamil cinema, citing the record number of film releases â€“ a staggering 256. â€œDespite a potentially lower ratio of hits to releases due to the sheer volume, the industryâ€™s turnover has seen a remarkable increase. This indicates a thriving business, doesnâ€™t it? Out of the 190 small-budget films released (made with less than Rs 5 crore), only a handful became hits, affecting the success ratio. However, the actual number of hits has risen.â€
A Silver Lining
Ramesh Bala, offering a more optimistic view, sees the success of Por Thozhil as a significant positive for Tamil cinema. In an era where marketing expenses often match the film budget, he points to Por Thozhilâ€™s minimal promotion yet substantial success, earning around Rs 40 crore gross. This achievement, he suggests, gives hope to filmmakers that quality content can yield results, even without extravagant promotion. â€œAbout 90 percent of films made here are small-budget ventures. Por Thozhil was one of them, and no one knew about it till its release. It worked solely because of word-of-mouth reviews, and I think it will give hope for many such filmmakers.â€
Pan-Indian Films Lose Luster
Although Rakesh and Dhananjeyan disagree on their assessments of Tamil cinemaâ€™s overall progress, they concur that Pan-Indian films have lost their appeal. Despite the sensational successes of 2022, such as KGF: Chapter 2, Kantara, Sita Ramam, RRR, and Charlie 777, the trend faltered in 2023, with Jawan being an exception. â€œTamil filmmakers must overcome their reluctance to release films alongside Pan-Indian productions from other states. This year, none of the Pan-Indian films, including Adipurush, Salaar, or Dunki, found success. The optimism of 2022 has waned, and 2023 has disappointed theatre owners, albeit with exception like Jailer,â€ opines Rakesh.
Dhananjeyan concurs, stating, â€œJawan is the sole exception, and even with Atlee, Nayanthara, and Vijay Sethupathi, it leaned more towards being a Tamil movie. This year, Salaar didnâ€™t meet expectations, signaling a failure of Pan-Indian films in Tamil cinema.â€
Challenges on the Horizon
ADVERTISEMENT
Despite the landmark successes of films like Jailer and Leo, which resonated beyond regional borders, Rakesh dismisses the notion that these triumphs compensate for the void left by mid-level film failures. â€œThe Tamil cinema market has expanded, but individual theater collections remain static. While there are more centers and avenues for Tamil cinema, the revenue for producers remains largely unchanged. The ticket price hike from Rs 120 to Rs 190 hasnâ€™t translated to a substantial increase in earnings.â€
Dhananjeyan, wearing his producer and distributor hat, identifies two imminent challenges for Tamil cinema. â€œOTT platforms are acquiring fewer films, presenting a challenge for the industry. Out of the 256 films released this year, only 140 found a place on digital platforms. Additionally, theatres face dwindling audience interest in smaller films, as viewers increasingly prefer watching them on OTT platforms. While a film like Por Thozhil stands out, it cannot single-handedly transform the industry. The audience must support smaller films, and OTTs need to expand their acquisition of such content.â€"
"Pierce Brosnan, whose fictitious movie character James Bond has been in hot water plenty of times, is now facing heat in real life, charged with stepping out of bounds in a thermal area during a recent visit to Yellowstone National Park.
Brosnan walked in an off-limits area at Mammoth Terraces, in the northern part of Yellowstone near the Wyoming-Montana line, on November 1, according to two federal citations issued on Tuesday.
Pierce Brosnan, 70, is scheduled for a mandatory court appearance on January 23 in the courtroom of the worldâ€™s oldest national park. The Associated Press sent a request for comment to his Instagram account on Thursday, and email messages to his agent and attorney.

Yellowstone officials declined to comment. Brosnan was in the park on a personal visit and not for film work, the U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office for Wyoming said.
Mammoth Terraces is a scenic spot of mineral-encrusted hot springs bubbling from a hillside. Theyâ€™re just some of the parkâ€™s hundreds of thermal features, which range from spouting geysers to gurgling mud pots, with water at or near the boiling point.
Going out-of-bounds in such areas can be dangerous: Some of the millions of people who visit Yellowstone each year get badly burned by ignoring warnings not to stray off the trail.
Getting caught can bring legal peril too, with jail time, hefty fines and bans from the park handed down to trespassers regularly.

"It was 2003 when filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani introduced iconic characters of Munna Bhai (Sanjay Dutt) and Circuit (Arshad Warsi) to the world with his iconic comedy film Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. To date, the movie is living rent-free in the hearts of moviegoers, courtesy Sanjay and Arshadâ€™s perfect comic timing, Hirani and Vidhu Vinod Chopraâ€™s partnership, and of course the story.
Interestingly, the makers continued tickling the audienceâ€™s funny bone with a sequel to the immensely successful Munnaibhai M.B.B.S. In 2006, Sanjay and Arshad reprised their roles of Munna and Circuit in Lage Raho Munna Bhai and successfully managed to make the audience laugh with a touch of Gandhigiri. With both the films, Sanjay and Arshadâ€™s characters earned a cult fan following.
Fans, no doubt, have been waiting in anticipation for the OG duo to return for Munna Bhai 3. Well, it seems like they will once again get a chance to deep dive into the world of Munna Bhai universe.

In an interview with ANI, Rajkumar Hirani hinted at Munna Bhai 3.
He said, â€œMunna Bhai ke sath humesha mera struggle yehi raha hai ki pichli do films itni achi ban gayi hai ki mere paas 5 aadhi likhi scripts abhi tak padi hui hai (The struggle with this film is that the first two films were blockbuster hits and I have five half-written scripts. I feel that if I donâ€™t reach the level of those two films, I wonâ€™t be able to make the third one. I have one story that can be made but some stories get outdated so only time will tell.)â€
â€œMeri aksar baat hoti rehti hai Sanju (Sanjay Dutt) se. Woh kehta hai ki ek banani chahiye. Abhi ye â€˜Dunkiâ€™ khatam hui hai toh ab main kholunga pitara purani kahanio ka. Man toh hai ki ek Munna Bhai aur banani hai pr kab woh mujhe abhi nahin pata (Sanju and I often discuss about Munna Bhai 3. He also tells me to make it. Dunki just finishedâ€¦now I will go through the collection of the old stories that I have. I really want to make Munna Bhai 3 but I donâ€™t know when),â€ he added.
Now it is to be seen when Rajkumar Hirani comes up with Munna Bhai 3.

Meanwhile, Hirani is currently being lauded for his latest directorial Dunki, which is headlined by Shah Rukh Khan.
Taapsee Pannu, Vicky Kaushal, Boman Irani, Anil Grover and Vikram Kochchar are also a part of Dunki, which focuses on the issue of immigration. Its title is taken from the term â€œdonkey routeâ€, which refers to the long-winding, often dangerous routes that people across the world take to reach the places they want to immigrate to.
The film hit the theatres on December 21 and is raking in decent numbers at the box office.

"Lijo Jose Pelliserry and Mohanlal have joined hands for the much-anticipated film of 2023, Malaikottai Vaaliban. A new song from the movie, â€œRaakkâ€, hints that the film could be a magical fantasy where the lead character played by Mohanlal is onto something. â€œRaakkâ€ gives a glimpse into what looks like a party with many who seem to be dancing in a frenzy induced by â€˜soma paanamâ€™.
Mohanlal has crooned the song along with many others to produce a potpourri of voices that are haunting and exciting at the same time.

According to lyricist PS Rafeeq, who is also the scriptwriter of Malaikottai Vaaliban, â€œRaakkâ€ is about a bunch of travelers spending a night together in a rest house.
He said, â€œThe Raakk song captures the essence of travelers spending their nights in a rest house. The real highlight of the song is Mohanlalâ€™s soulful rendition, delivered with utmost beauty and vibrancy. While every song in the movie is special, some gain extra significance due to their unique backstories, and the Raakk song is one such special gem.â€
Directed by Lijo Jose Pellissery, Malaikottai Vaaliban is set to release in Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Hindi. Other than Mohanlal, the film also stars Sonalee Kulkarni, Hareesh Peradi, Danish Sait, Manoj Moses, Katha Nandi, and Manikandan Achari. It is produced by John & Mary Creative, Century Films, Maxlab & Saregama. With cinematography by Madhu Neelakandan, Malaikottai Vaaliban is set to hit screens on January 25, 2024."
"The action-drama Salaar, starring Prabhas and Prithviraj Sukumaran, is witnessing a constant dip in its box office collection. The film entered its second week on Friday and saw a substantial drop from its first Friday, when it opened in theatres with a collection of Rs 90.7 crore.
Salaarâ€™s box office collection on the eighth day was Rs 9.62 crore by 9 pm, according to industry tracker Sacnilk. This brings the filmâ€™s total nett collection in India to Rs 317.62 crore. The craze around Prabhas helped the film earn Rs 110.48 crore in the Hindi-speaking belt alone, where the audience also had the option to watch Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Dunki, which was released just a day ahead of Salaar.
On Friday, the film had the maximum occupancy in the Telugu-speaking states (27.11%). The Malayalam occupancy was 17.17% and Tamil occupancy was 19.32%. Film trade expert Manobala Vijayabalan shared that the movie has earned Rs 542.63 crore globally. This is the seventh film of the year to cross the Rs 500 crore mark worldwide after Pathaan, Jawan, Leo, Gadar 2, Jailer and Animal.

Salaar has received a mixed response from film critics and audiences. The Indian Expressâ€™ film critic Shubhra Gupta wrote in her review of the movie, â€œTill the violence in Prabhas-Prithviraj-starrer is comic-book and â€˜Games Of Thronesâ€™-type stylised, you can find a way to rationalise it; the trouble ratchets up when it becomes more real.â€"
"Actor Sivakarthikeyanâ€™s long-delayed film Ayalaan will be finally released on Pongal and compete with Dhanushâ€™s Captain Miller, and Aishwarya Rajinikanthâ€™s Laal Salaam. Ayalaan, a sci-fi action drama, was announced way back in 2016. However, it has taken more than seven years for the film to see the light of day. In a recent interview, Sivakarthikeyan opened up about the reasons behind the delay, and the financial problems the film went through. He also assured that a second part of the movie is on the cards.
Talking about the film, Siva told Galatta Plus, â€œI loved director Ravikumarâ€™s Netru Indru Naalaiâ€¦ how he had pulled off such a film with limited means. So, when he told me he had an idea for a story about an alien meeting me, I told him we are doing it. Later, we started working on the story and it has become what it is now.â€

When asked about the reason behind the delay of Ayalaan, Sivakarthikeyan said, â€œAs far as Ayaalan is concerned, it is a vision to make such a film in Tamil on a limited budget. When I say small budget, it is a huge one for me. It is not a film made with Rs 200 crore, but it will look like it is that big. There is no reference for us while making the film. We just have Hollywood films, but we canâ€™t ape them. So, it took a long time to make it. If not for the pandemic, we would have finished way earlier.â€
ADVERTISEMENT
He added, â€œSoftware companies could function from home, but CGI work canâ€™t be done since no one has systems that powerful at home. So, it came to a halt. Then we had to start all over again. Initially, there were financial problems. Then we sorted it all out and when we were about to make the film, COVID hit. Then we had to wait and do it. But the delay has helped him (Ravikumar) use new technologies in the film. I can assure you that no other Indian film has been made like Ayalaan. It will be a new experience for the audience.â€
Talking about the financial issues, he added, â€œIt is true that there were fund issues, but it is not a film that can be salvaged with a small budget. We wanted to do justice to it and so we waited to make it work. There was a time when it looked like the project couldnâ€™t be finished, but now, it is ready for release. We are going to see the final in a few days. We have overcome all the struggles to get here, and it will be released on Pongal.â€
Sivakarthikeyan is sure of Ayalaanâ€™s success and he is confident that there will be a second part to the film. â€œMaking the film has been a learning in itself that we now have an idea of what to do. So, we have now figured out there are other ways to achieve what we want and we will be using it for part 2. Yes, I believe that this character will be liked by all, and I think there is a scope for a part 2.â€

"Vijayakanth, the founder of Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), was laid to rest at his party headquarters in Koyambedu, Chennai with full state honour. 72 rounds of gunshots were fired to honour the veteran actor-politician. Many political leaders and celebrities including Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin, Ministers TR Balu, Udhayanidhi Stalin, KN Nehru, former CM O Panneerselvam, BJP leader Tamilisai Soundarajan, GK Vasan, and Jeyakumar were present at the funeral. The whole of Koyembedu was jam-packed with people pouring in from different parts of the state to get a last glimpse of â€˜Captainâ€™.
Ahead of the funeral, the mortal remains of Vijayakanth were taken for a final journey across the streets of Chennai. People stood on either side of the streets and threw flowers at the vehicle. Vijayakanthâ€™s sons Shanmugha Pandian and Vijay Prabhakaran were on the van thanking the public.
Vijayakanth was laid to rest in a coffin made of sandalwood. â€œPuratchi Kalaingan Captain Vijayakanthâ€ was engraved on the coffin.

Earlier, Rajinikanth, who was spotted at Tutucorin airport, expressed his condolences. He said,  â€œMy heart aches. Vijayakanth was a man with great willpower. Lastly, I saw him at the DMDKâ€™s genral body meeting and thought he would bounce back after battling his health issues. His death is a huge loss to the people of Tamil Nadu.â€
The actor added, â€œIf he was healthy, he would have been a formidable force in politics. He would have done so many good deeds for the people. People of Tamil Nadu have now lost him. May his soul rest in peace.â€
Vijayakanth, whose original name is Narayanan Vijayaraj Alagarswami, rebelled against his dad who wanted him to take care of the family business of running a rice mill. He, however, had dreams of becoming an actor and realised it after many struggles in the industry which looked down upon dark-skinned actors and outsiders.

Over the years, Vijayakanth became a formidable force in Kollywood churning out hits that were on par with the films of Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan. Captain Prabhakaran, Vaidheigi Kaathirundhaal, Oor Katha Kaavalan, Nooraavathu Naal, Oomai Vizhigal, Naane Raja Naane Mandhiri, Chinna Gounder, Vaanathai Pola, Chatriyan, and Ramana are some of his biggest hits.
The actor, who always had political aspirations and was a believer in Dravidian ideology, made his foray into politics by floating his party in 2008. The start of DMDK became a new chapter in Tamil Nadu as it became the third-largest party in a very short time. Vijayakanth also served as the leader of the opposition between the years 2011 to 2014.
Later, due to a health issue, the actor couldnâ€™t be at his best, which affected the electoral performance of his party. The leadership was later transferred to his wife Premalatha.
Vijayakanth was suffering from a lung-related illness and was admitted to MIOT hospital a few weeks ago. He was discharged on December 11. However, the actor-politician tested positive for coronavirus and was hospitalized again on Tuesday. After being put on ventilator support, Vijayakanth breathed his last on Thursday morning, leaving millions of his fans and followers devastated."
"Reacher is back. And allâ€™s well with the world. Or will be, as soon as he and his three palsâ€“ whose bonds go back to the time when they were in the military togetherâ€“rumble the bad guys, destroy them, and, as best-selling author Lee Child has them succinctly declare, â€˜piss on their ancestorsâ€™ grave.â€™ End of matter.
In season one, we were introduced to Alan Ritchson, who instantly fixed the major problem with the two feature films in which Tom Cruise tried being Jack Reacher: Ritchson was six feet plus, as big horizontally as he was vertically, just the way Childâ€™s eponymous hero ought to have been, instead of the compact Cruise.
It was impossible to buy the suave Hollywood star as the big-as-a-boardwalk ex-Army drifter who lives rough, packs a toothbrush as his only luggage, refuses to be tied down by real estate-and-paperwork, and roams around the US countryside, passing through small towns in which live big villains, dealing with them the only way he knows how: getting in his massive blow, or head-butt, first.
ADVERTISEMENT
In season 2, based on Childâ€™s 11th novel â€˜Bad Luck And Troubleâ€™, and developed by Nick Santora, he looms even larger, and is as fearsome. This time around, things have got personal: a member of his old Army unit has been murdered in the most brutal fashion, and it looks like someone has it in for the rest of them. Back when they were a tightly-knit band, they had a saying: you do not mess with the Special Investigators. Now someone clearly has, and as far as Reacher is concerned, thatâ€™s the end of that someone. Or someones.
The three friends who get together with Reacher on this mission are remnants of that old unit. Their addition makes things more interesting, especially when we need a bit of chatter in between all the action: thumping people with his bare hands is the big manâ€™s forte; he leaves conversation to other people. Frances Neagley (Maria Sten), whom we met briefly in the first season, is back with her sharp sleuthing instincts: David Oâ€™Donnell (Shaun Sipos) as the spiffy knife-man, and Karla Dixon ( Serinda Swan) as the numbers whizz, slip into step smoothly, as we follow them from New York to Vegas and all kinds of places in between as they start tracking those who killed their friends.

In the first season in early 2022, we got all the episodes at once. This new series has launched with three episodes together, followed by one every week. Five episodes down, three to go, and weâ€™ve had one-on-one combats, car crashes, gun battles, cops-hot-the-trail-of-Reacher, a very bad guy leaving a trail of bodies in his wake, fancy weapon prototypes, dirty drugs dealers, bent arms manufacturers. Bone-crunching, blood-spraying, hit-â€™em-till-they-are-dead fast-paced scenes follow each other: the story-telling is basic, but it gets the job done without wasting any time, and itâ€™s all just as it should be, for Reacher fans. Weâ€™re going to do a whole lot of cowboy shit, declares Reacher, as the fifth episode comes to an end, and thatâ€™s exactly what Iâ€™m here for.
While I wait impatiently for the next, and the next, Iâ€™m back to re-reading the book, and it is as much of an adrenalin-pump as it always is."
"Nag Ashwin directorial Kalki 2898 AD, starring Prabhas, Amitabh Bachchan, Deepika Padukone and Kamal Haasan, among others, is being touted as â€œIndiaâ€™s Mytho-Sci-fi Epicâ€ by the makers. Recently, Ashwin attended an event at IIT Bombay, where he spoke about his dystopian drama, the filmâ€™s title and his experience of working with stalwarts like Bachchan and Haasan.
When an audience member asked Ashwin, why the film, which was earlier called Project K, has been titled Kalki 2898 AD and why specifically the 2898 AD, the filmmaker replied, â€œThere is one logic to it which I will reveal closer to the filmâ€™s release date. But there is a logic, I donâ€™t know how true or accurate it is.â€ When another person asked why Kalki, the director added, â€œItâ€™s a very powerful name and it is something which is connected to present and past, and thatâ€™s what the story (of the film) is.â€ The tenth avatar of Lord Vishnu is also called Kalki.
Going by the teaser which was unveiled at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2023, Kalki 2898 AD looks like it revolves around a war between two factions. The film is backed by an able cast and Nag Ashwin had a great time working with them. â€œAll of them are very humble and make the life of their director easy. They love cinema,â€ the filmmaker said about Amitabh Bachchan, Kamal Haasan and Prabhas.

Kalki 2898 AD has been in the making for almost 4-5 years now, and during its making, Ashwin felt he is doing â€œengineering, not filmmakingâ€ as everything, from the props and costumes to the sets was built â€œfrom scratchâ€.
â€œIn India, we do not have a lot of sci-fi films. We have done a few time travel films. This one is different because itâ€™s in a whole separate world on its own. Also, in the international sense, it is new because we have not seen India in a future setting or dystopian setting. So now we donâ€™t have to look at London and New York being born, now we can see our cities also,â€ Aswin spoke about his film.
He added, â€œThis movie took place in the cusp between before and after Midjourney and before and after Chat GPT. First two years, we did a lot of work and then we realised a lot of work became easier after this text-to-image and image-to-text generator happened.â€

"â€˜Zindagi kaisi hai paheli, kabhi toh hasaaye, kabhi ye rulaayeâ€™
There couldnâ€™t have been a better song written for Rajesh Khanna â€“ the handsome, twinkle-eyed heart-stealer of late 1960s and 1970s Hindi cinema. With his boy-next-door looks, chivalry and his swoon-worthy romantic actions, he robbed the audience of critical thinking and charmed them, especially women, with his roles of a lover. He came at a time when the audience was done revering middle-aged heroes (Rajendra Kumar, Dilip Kumar) and wanted a new generation actor to express their dreams and desires onscreen. Not just youngsters, but even the older generation lapped up this storehouse of talent.
â€œIn all my films, people identified strongly with my character. Every college girl wanted a boyfriend like me, every mother wanted her son to be like me, and every sister wanted her brother to be like me. All the married women dreamt of a husband like me. Together, they made Rajesh Khanna the screen idol that he was,â€ the actor had said in a 1989 interview.

Rajesh Khanna was unlike todayâ€™s stars. He didnâ€™t have a well-built physique or looks that would stop people in their tracks, yet he managed to turn heads as he brought a stamp of class and sensitivity to his characters. Moviegoers connected with him as he conveyed their emotional vulnerabilities on screen with the utmost sincerity and passion. Hrishikesh Mukherjee, as actor Rakhee told Etimes, believed, â€œNobody can compete with Rajesh Khanna. It is impossible. He wasnâ€™t there for his body and height but just for his face, smile and eyes.â€
While he did impress with his initial films like Aakhri Khat (1966), Raaz (1967) and Baharon Ke Sapne (1967), Khanna came to his own and became invincible with Aradhana (1969), Do Raaste (1969), Ittefaq (1969), Safar (1970), Kati Patang (1971), Khamoshi (1969), and several others. Actor Deepti Naval, who watched Khannaâ€™s Aradhana thirteen times with her sister, told Scroll, â€œHe was the dream man of every girl. I felt no other actor could have done â€˜Roop tera mastanaâ€™ like Rajesh Khanna, treading a fine line between forbidden love and desireâ€¦â€ Naval and her sister even wore a Guru kurta to watch his film Safar. â€œWe were that crazy about Rajesh Khanna.â€ Not just the actor and her sister, millions of girls were in love with the â€˜superstarâ€™. He used to receive fan mail in abundance, some of which were supposedly written in blood. His car would be covered in lipstick marks wherever it was parked.

Sharmila Tagore said in an interview with The Indian Express, â€œWomen came out in droves to see Kaka (Khanna). They would stand in queues outside the studios to catch a glimpse. They would marry his photographs, and they would pull at his clothes. Delhi girls were crazier for him than Mumbai girls. He needed police protection when he was in public. I have never seen anything like this before and since.â€
Born Jatin Khanna, on December 29, 1942, in Amritsar, Punjab, the actor was brought up by foster parents, Chunnilal and Leelawati Khanna, and he never spoke of his biological parents. He was a much-pampered kid who attended Mumbaiâ€™s St Sebastian Goan High School, where he became friends with Ravi Kapoor, who later gained popularity as Jeetendra. After completing his studies at Kishinchand Chelleram College, Khanna, who was already doing theatre, decided to pursue acting. He approached several filmmakers with his pictures but got no response from them. But Khannaâ€™s struggle story was a little different from others as he came from a well-to-do family that was willing to support him financially. Gautam Chintamaniâ€™s biography on the actor mentioned that he â€œdrove to auditions in a car and had a monthly allowance of Rs 10,000.â€
Mumtaz and Rajesh Khanna were hit on-screen pair.
In 1965, he was presented with a unique opportunity as some of the famous producers and directors from the Hindi film industry, including BR Chopra, Guru Dutt, and Bimal Roy, organised a talent contest along with Filmfare to find a new face for the film industry.

Rajesh Khanna beat 10,000 contestants and won the 1965 All India Talent Contest organised by United Producers and Filmfare. The talent hunt contract specified that 12 different producers would sign the winner for 12 films. Hence, a golden chance to rise to stardom. The first film he signed was GP Sippyâ€™s Raaz and subsequently, Chetan Anand approached him for Aakhri Khat. Though he was happy to have gotten two films early in his career, what bothered him was the call time for Raaz, which was 9 am. He told Bhawana Somaya for â€˜Echoes of an Eraâ€™, â€œNow, waking up early is just not my style. I am not an early bird. From childhood, I have always risen late. My mother wouldnâ€™t allow anyone to enter my room and disturb me. So when the director told me about attending shooting early in the morning, my heart sank.â€

On the day of the shoot, Khanna arrived at 11 am and instead of being apologetic, he hit back at a senior team member who questioned his behaviour despite being a newcomer, â€œTo hell with the career and to hell with this film. My lifestyle cannot change for my career.â€ This remained the actorâ€™s attitude throughout his career, as confirmed by Prem Chopra in one of his interviews. â€œRajesh Khanna was a great actor, but he had this habit of reaching late all the time. Not everyone would take it when he landed late on sets. Hours after everyone reached and got ready, he would reach the sets.â€ Even in her latest appearance on Koffee With Karan, when Sharmila Tagore was asked to describe Khanna in two words, she replied, â€œPerpetually late.â€
However, filmmakers grew habitual of Khannaâ€™s habit of always turning up late and continued to cast him for his impeccable screen presence. The actor holds the record of delivering 17 consecutive super-hits in three years from 1969-71, which included 15 successive solo super-hit films, starting with Ittefaq (1969) and Aradhana (1969). Ramesh Deo, who played Dr Prakash in Anand, recalled that Khanna was perpetually late on the sets of Anand, and this would infuriate Hrishikesh Mukherjee. But as soon as he saw what the actor did in front of the camera, his anger would melt away. In a 2012 conversation with DNA, Deo said, â€œRajesh used to enact the scene so well, that after the scene, Hrishi-da used to say, â€˜Tumne itna aacha kam kiya hai, tumhare sau gunah maaf (You have done such good work that all your sins are forgiven).â€™â€
Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan (left) in Anand.
By the time Anand released in 1971, Khanna had reached the pinnacle of success and had become a â€˜phenomenonâ€™. The mass hysteria around him remains unbeatable to this day. In fact, at one point, he himself felt, â€œnext to Godâ€.

â€œHe was the biggest star ever. From 1969 to 1975, the high that he touched became a benchmark that nobody could breach. You could identify with him. He had a very charming smile. He had a good voice and he also got really good music. When a personâ€™s stars start working in his favour, then he gets support from every sphere,â€ screenwriter Salim Khan once said about Khanna to BBC.

However, by the mid-seventies, Rajesh Khannaâ€™s hold over the box office had begun to slip, increasing his insecurities. He only wished to be surrounded by people who praised him, and those who spoke anything which was not favourable to him became his enemy. His starry tantrums were no longer taken by filmmakers and he was once reportedly slapped by Mehmood when he was directing him in Janta Hawaldar. Yash Chopra also couldnâ€™t handle his â€œsuperstar tantrums on a regular basisâ€. In 1973, when Khanna worked with the emerging star Amitabh Bachchan, he believed nobody could replace him. Actor Asrani recalled in a 2018 interview with Filmfare, â€œThere was a basic courtesy between the two but Rajesh suffered from a superiority complex. He believed â€˜no one can shake me. I am too powerful.â€™ Throughout the film, there was palpable tension between the two.â€
The dried-up offers were also a result of Khannaâ€™s unwillingness to reinvent himself. â€œHe continued the same style and those films did not work either. That is why he had to (suffer a downfall). He could not face that thing â€“ where I was and where I am now,â€ Prem Chopra had said while explaining the superstarâ€™s downfall from the numer-uno position.
ADVERTISEMENT
The failure led him to alcoholism and one night after drinking, he started yelling from the terrace of his Mumbai bungalow, Ashirvaad. This was the phase of Khannaâ€™s career when he had seven consecutive flops. â€œOne after another, seven films had just flopped in a row. It was raining, pitch-dark and up there alone on my terrace, I lost control. I yelled out. â€˜Parvardigar, hum garibon ka itna sakt imtihan na le ki hum tere vajood ko inkar kar de (God, donâ€™t test my patience to such an extent that I question your very existence).â€™ Of course, Dimple (Kapadia, his wife) and my staff came running, thinking that I had gone insane. It was because success hit me so much that I couldnâ€™t take the failure,â€ he shared with Movie Magazine in 1990.
One of the actorâ€™s dialogues from Daag (1973) sums up the ups and downs of his life, which he later recreated on the stage at an event with much of the film industry in attendance, â€œIzzatein, shohratein, ulfatein, chahatein, sab kuch iss duniya mein rehta nahin/ Aaj main hun jahan kal koi aur tha/ Ye bhi ek daur hai woh bhi ek daur tha. (Nothing is permanent in life. somebody else was here where I am today).â€ A day came in Khannaâ€™s life when he, who once felt â€œnext to Godâ€, thought of himself to be a â€˜dogâ€™.

He told Filmfare, â€œI used to ask my man Prashant to tell the caller that Kaka is having a bath and call up again just to feign importance and attend to the call only when the caller called up four times. God punished me and a time came when I used to stand next to the phone hoping that I would get a call. And when one day a call came, I picked the receiver and said,â€™ Kaka here,â€™ and then came the reply, â€˜Kaun Kaka? Wrong Number.â€™ That was when I realized that I was not GOD but DOG.â€

Rajesh Khanna continued to work in the 80s, but unlike the early 1970s, he failed to pull people to cinema halls. One of the last notable roles that he did was in Rishi Kapoorâ€™s Aa Ab Laut Chelein in 1999.
At the peak of his career, Khanna married 16-year-old Dimple Kapadia, whom he met on a flight to Ahmedabad. The two got married six months before Kapadiaâ€™s Bobby released. But Kapadia knew her marriage with the superstar wouldnâ€™t last long from the moment she stepped into his house. On The Pritish Nandy Show, the actor said she could not understand the superstar. Revisiting the pre-separation phase of her life, Kapadia said, â€œI think we were two very different kinds of people. I was probably very young to understand what was happening to this man, who was a superstar. I have never been able to understand stars and their behaviour pattern at all because I am not one myself.

The duo separated in 1982 and have two daughters â€“ Twinkle Khanna, who was born in 1974, and Rinkie Khanna, born in 1977.
Before marrying Dimple, Rajesh Khanna was in a seven-year-long relationship with Anju Mahendru. When he married Kapadia, he deliberately made his baraat parade before Anjuâ€™s house. After separating from Kapadia, he also got involved with Tina Munim, who allegedly left him because he didnâ€™t divorce Kapadia.

Journalist Bhawana Somaaya summarised Khannaâ€™s life in a Screen article which was published in 1987: â€œRajesh Khanna became more rigid and withdrew into his shell. If Anju couldnâ€™t cope with his success, Dimple couldnâ€™t cope with his failure.â€
But, all the people he was close to returned to him during his last days, including Dimple Kapadia and her daughter, and Anju Mahendru. He was admitted to Mumbaiâ€™s Lilavati Hospital due to prolonged illness, but he insisted on dying in his bedroom. The family brought him back to Aashirvaad and tried to lift his spirit by saying that he will be well soon. But Khanna knew it was time on July 18, 2012. Yasser Usman revealed the actorâ€™s last word in his biography, â€œTime up ho gaya [My time is up] . . . Pack up!â€

"Prabhasâ€™ Saalar Part 1: Ceasefire might have not pulled off a KGF at the box office, but it is a triumphant comeback for the Rebel star. As the film has crossed the Rs 500-crore mark at the box office, Prabhas has already moved on to his next project. The actor is teaming up with director Maruthi for the film. A concept poster of the movie, said to be titled Raja Deluxe, was unveiled on Friday.
The poster also revealed the new avatar of Prabhas will be unveiled on Pongal.

â€” Director Maruthi (@DirectorMaruthi) December 29, 2023
Looks like Prabhas is letting go of the monochrome palette of Salaar. The poster of the upcoming film is as colourful as it can get, in contrast to the Prashanth Neel directorial. The Rebel star seems to be taking a break from all the violence with this movie.
Maruthi has also doubled up as a producer for the film. The other cast and crew details of the movie have not been revealed yet, and it is expected on Pongal.
Maruthi is known for his commercial hits like Pucca Commercial, Prema Katha Chitram, and Bhale Bhale Magadivoy. It has to be seen what the director, who has been making out-and-out commercial films will do with Prabhas, who has transcended borders.
Meanwhile, Prabhas is also working on Kalki AD2898, directed by Nag Ashwin. The sci-fi venture has brought together some of the biggest talents of Indian cinema, including Deepika Padukone, Amitabh Bachchan, and Kamal Haasan."
"Dino Morea was one of the most famous models in the 1990s and when he made his debut in Hindi movies in the late 1990s with Pyar Mein Kabhi Kabhi, the audience saw him as a part of the generation of actors who had something new to offer. Soon after, Dino appeared in the 2002 film Raaz with Bipasha Basu, which is possibly the most popular movie of his career. In a recent chat with Bollywood Bubble, Dino spoke about his debut film and called Bipasha his most favourite co-star.
Back in the day, Bipasha and Dino also dated each other and were not shy about discussing their relationship. When asked about his favourite co-star from the early 2000s, Dino said, â€œBipasha, she was in most of my movies. She has to be my favourite co-star.â€ And when he was asked about the most iconic film of the early 2000s, Dino named his own film Raaz and said, â€œIt was one of the biggest successes of 2002. That movie did hugely well even though we didnâ€™t win a single award, which is very weird.â€

Speaking about his debut film Pyar Mein Kabhi Kabhi, Dino Morea recalled that â€œit was a lot of funâ€. He said, â€œWe were going city to city promoting our film. The songs were already a hit.â€ The actor added, â€œI come out of the theatre, people were pulling my jacket. It was just fantastic.â€
Dino shared that he took a break from the movies around 2011 because he wasnâ€™t getting the kind of offers that would have helped him advance his career. â€œWhen films donâ€™t work one after the other, you keep wondering whatâ€™s going on and thatâ€™s when I made the conscious decision to say no to any work that was really not good. And I made that decision in 2011-2012. Every offer that came to me after that was just terrible and I just said no. You just have to have faith in yourself.â€ But five years later, things picked up again as Dino was offered The Empire, Tandav, Mentalhood and Hostages.
Dino Morea was last seen in the Telugu film Agent.

"One of the most gut-wrenching scenes in all of modern cinema comes at the end of Werner Herzogâ€™s 2005 documentary, Grizzly Man. The film tells the tragic story of Timothy Treadwell, an outdoorsy American man who made the mistake â€” as so many of Herzogâ€™s protagonists do â€” of staring into the abyss without bothering to consider the consequences. Treadwell was killed by a grizzly bear that heâ€™d deluded himself into thinking he could tame. They recovered audio of the fatal attack, which Herzog listens to on camera in the film, but crucially, restricts from the audience. It distressed him to the point that he instructed Treadwellâ€™s ex-girlfriend to destroy it immediately.
Directors Amanda McBaine and Jesse Moss perhaps came across a similar ethical dilemma in their new film, The Mission, which in many ways can be seen as a thematic companion piece to Grizzly Man. Like Herzogâ€™s classic, the documentary follows the exploits of another adventurer â€” the Evangelical missionary John Allen Chau â€” who got more than what he bargained for after making illegal contact with the Sentinelese tribe in the Andaman Islands. The Sentinelese are perhaps the worldâ€™s most isolated community, having fended away almost all attempts at communication by the outside world.

ADVERTISEMENT
Chau, a mixed-race American who grew up in the â€˜90s, slowly became obsessed with the idea of converting the Sentinelese to Christianity. He believed that the island was Satanâ€™s last great stronghold, and that only he could bring the Gospel of Christ to the 200-odd people who are said to live there. Chau wasnâ€™t always a religious zealot, however. He grew up on The Adventures of Tintin and Robinson Crusoe, but found himself drifting away from conventional pop-culture in his teens, as he became completely entrenched in the Evangelical movement.
Chauâ€™s life story is recounted in gorgeously animated sequences by his own father, who openly blames the Evangelicals for what happened to him. Chau was aware that the Indian government had forbidden all contact with the Sentinelese. He also knew that several past expeditions had ended with the Sentinelese giving clear warning signs to incoming explorers by aiming arrows at them. One of the most enduring images of the tribe â€” this also gives the filmâ€™s producers, National Geographic, a chance to offer internal critique about the westâ€™s messiah complex â€” forever painting them as the savages in the eyes of the â€˜civilisedâ€™ world.
The movie makes an honest attempt at capturing the complex blend of obsession, devotion, and delusion that sent John Allen Chau on his suicide mission. Perhaps the most interesting interviewee â€” the movie also features one of Chauâ€™s old friends, and his many enablers from the Evangelical community â€” is the linguist Daniel Everett, who sees in Chau a kindred spirit, and harbours a vague sense of guilt over what happened to him. Everett spent decades with the PirahÃ£ people of the Amazon, initially with the intention of teaching them the Lordâ€™s ways. But in an unexpected turn of events, he found his own faith crumbling when the PirahÃ£ started resisting his lessons.
Heâ€™s a fascinating character, someone who tears up at the mere memory of an old aphorism â€” â€œHe gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose.â€ â€” and freely admits that his three-decade mission might have been a waste of time. Whatever statements that The Mission is unable to make in literal terms, it makes by awarding Everett a large chunk of the screen time. But he isnâ€™t a martyr, not like Chau.

We see endless self-shot footage of Chau climbing mountains, jumping into rivers, scurrying along narrow forest paths â€” visuals that could ostensibly project him as a â€˜regularâ€™ person. But Everett offers perhaps the filmâ€™s most sobering observation, when he warns that Chauâ€™s reckless actions might inspire others to make similar illegal incursions into forbidden territory. Itâ€™s a dangerous proposition, and as one person keenly notes, none of this takes into consideration what the Sentinelese might want.

"Oscar-winning actor Gary Oldman says he is not a fan of his performance as Sirius Black in the Harry Potter franchise. During his appearance on the latest episode of the Happy Sad Confused podcast, the British actor said his portrayal of the fan-favourite character was â€œmediocreâ€.
â€œI think my work is mediocre in it. No, I do. Maybe if I had read the books like Alan (Rickman, who played Severus Snape), if I had got ahead of the curve, if I had known whatâ€™s coming, I honestly think I would have played it differently,â€ Oldman said.
The Harry Potter movies were adapted from author JK Rowlingâ€™s book series of the same title. The franchise titles are The Philosopherâ€™s Stone, The Chamber of Secrets, The Prisoner of Azkaban, The Goblet of Fire, The Order of the Phoenix, The Half-Blood Prince and The Deathly Hallows â€“ Part 1 & 2.

Gary Oldman had starred as Sirius Black in The Prisoner of Azkaban, The Goblet of Fire, The Order of the Phoenix and The Deathly Hallows Part 2.
The 65-year-old actor admitted that he often criticises his performances in films.
â€œIâ€™ll tell you what it is. Itâ€™s like anything, I think if I sat and watched myself in something and said, â€˜My God, Iâ€™m amazing,â€™ that would be a very sad day, because you want to make the next thing better,â€ Oldman said.

â€œItâ€™s so subjective. Itâ€™s such a personal thing that youâ€™re looking at that other people are not seeingâ€¦ Itâ€™s not to disrespect someone who says to me, â€˜Oh, I really love you in that movie,â€™ and Iâ€™m thinking, â€˜Iâ€™m terrible in that movie. What are they talking about?â€™ Itâ€™s not that. Itâ€™s (that) theyâ€™re seeing something else,â€ he added.

Recently, Gary Oldman had revealed that being part of popular franchises Harry Potter and Christopher Nolanâ€™s The Dark Knight trilogy â€œsavedâ€ him as a single father.
In Nolanâ€™s movies, which featured Christian Bale as superhero The Batman, Oldman had essayed the role of Commissioner Gordon.
â€œAt 42 years old, I woke up, you know, sort of divorced and I had custody of these boys. That, in itself, was â€¦ that was hard because there was a shift in the industry where a lot of productions wereâ€¦ in Hungary, Budapest, Prague, Australia, you know, all of these places. So, I turned down a lot of work.
â€œThank God for Harry Potter. I tell you, the two â€” Batman and Harry Potter â€” really, they saved me, because it meant that I could do the least amount of work for the most amount of money and then be home with the kids,â€ Oldman had said during his appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show.

"Actor Shah Rukh Khan was left in splits when his Dunki co-star Vikram Kochhar was slapped really hard in a scene. Vikram said he was determined to give a realistic shot and ended up getting hit hard.
In an interview with VS Talks, Vikram recalled how he encouraged his onscreen mother (played by Sapna Sand) to slap him as hard as possible in a scene. The actors ended up making a memorable moment.
Recalling Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s reaction, Vikram said, â€œBehind the camera, Shah Rukh sir was standing, and he couldnâ€™t control his laughter. On that silent set, the sound of the slap was so loud and there Shah sir is doing (enacts laughter). And he is not in front of the camera, but standing behind it and laughing.â€

For Vikram, Shah Rukhâ€™s laughter served as an encouragement. He told Sapna to slap again if needed.
â€œEk baar wo maar ke conscious ho gayi lekin pade usne baad 2-3 aur bhi. Maine kaha koi baat nahi badiya hai . Yaha par agar shah Rukh sir hass sakte hai to audience bhi hasegi. Letâ€™s do it.

Directed by Rajkumar Hirani, Dunki is Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s third release this year after Jawan and Pathaan. The film also stars Taapsee Pannu, Boman Irani and Vicky Kaushal in pivotal roles.

"The latest episode of Koffee with Karan season eight saw the mother-son duo Sharmila Tagore and Saif Ali Khan appearing as guests. On the episode, Saif and Sharmila got candid about their relationship, and also narrated anecdotes about their youth. However, Sharmila was stunned to discover that neither her son nor Karan knows the meaning of â€˜putra mohâ€™.
When Karan Johar observed that they share a unique relationship, Sharmila interrupted him, and described her feelings towards Saif in two words: â€œPutra moh (attachment for son).â€ However, failing to understand what his mother meant, Saif immediately asked, â€œWhatâ€™s putra moh?â€ He continued, â€œOh, itâ€™s Bengaliâ€.

"The success of last yearâ€™s Bimbisara still augurs well for Kalyan Ram, despite the poor show of his Amigos earlier this year. The choice of a British-era story has worked well in creating interest in this film. Samyuktha also lends support here. Pushing all these factors is producer Abhishek Nama, who raked up controversy by removing director Navin Medaram from the movie and declaring himself the chief architect of the film. Has the gamble worked? Letâ€™s see.
Devil is all about spies, double agents working for the British or the Indian National Army headed by Subhash Chandra Bose. It is all taking place at the time when Bose is contemplating returning to India, and the British are working hard to catch him. The central stage of this drama is Rasapadu, a coastal town in Madras Presidency, with a British secret agent named Devil (Kalyan Ram) running a bigger operation pretending to solve the murder of a Zamindarâ€™s daughter. Playing other characters of interest are Samyuktha, Vashistha Simha, Satya, Shafi, Ester, Ajay and Malavika Nair.

Actor Vikram Kochhar, who played a key role in the comedy drama, recently shared in an interview that nerves got the best of another supporting actor, who was replaced on the first day itself.
When asked about his first day on the set of Dunki, Vikram told Home Bollywud that SRK wasnâ€™t in any of the scenes that day, but he recalled another incident. Vikram said that another actor from Punjab was with them on set, but there was some miscommunication between him and Hirani. â€œWhat he had done in his audition, he wasnâ€™t able to translate on set. We were all a little nervous. You are affected when you are working with someone big. So, just the thought that you are in the first shot of a Rajkumar Hirani film, which is being made after so many years, so you are bound to get nervous. Itâ€™s a big responsibility that you have.

"Javed Akhtar has written some of the most popular Hindi film songs of all time, and in a recent interview, the veteran writer recalled the circumstances in which he wrote the romantic song â€˜Ek Ladki Ko Dekhaâ€™ from 1942: A Love Story. Picturised on Anil Kapoor and Manisha Koirala, the song is often described as one of the most romantic Hindi film songs of the 1990s, but for Javed, the source of inspiration for this song was â€˜terrorâ€™.
Talking to Red FM India, Javed said that he was the one who suggested to director Vidhu Vinod Chopra that the scene in question demanded a song, but as soon as he walked out of that meeting, he forgot about it. He shared, â€œI suggested that there could be a good song here. He said, â€˜No, itâ€™s not the right place. The boy and girl have not even met yet. He has only seen a glimpse of her and he doesnâ€™t even know that she lives here, he is still looking for her, where will we fit a song here? And anyway there is a romantic song in a while so whatâ€™s the point of a song here?'â€ But since Javed insisted, Vinod asked him to write a song and present it four days later.

"After a steady run at the box office, Shah Rukh Khanâ€˜s Dunki has hit single-digit territory for the first time since its December 21 release. According to the industry tracker Sacnilk, the film made Rs 9 crore in India on its eighth day of release. This is the filmâ€™s lowest single-day haul yet, but a bump in numbers is expected over the weekend.
Dunki had a solid opening of nearly Rs 30 crore last Thursday. However, the filmâ€™s performance was compared unfavourably to Shah Rukhâ€™s last two blockbusters, Pathaan, which made Rs 57 crore on day one, and Jawan, which made Rs 75 crore on opening day. Despite the relatively smaller opening, director Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s film has now made Rs 161 crore nett in India, and should comfortably pass the Rs 200 crore mark over its second weekend.

"From Dilip Kumar and Raj Kapoor to Kamal Haasan, Naseeruddin Shah and Irrfan Khan, Indian cinema has consistently had extraordinary male actors who, along with their female counterparts, significantly impacted and moulded visual art, while in/directly enabling writers and directors to push boundaries, resulting in the creation of more intricate works.
Although these actors have mutually inspired each other and subsequent generations of talent, leaving a lasting impact on viewers as well, the influence of Amitabh Bachchan in the realm of Indian cinema remains unmatched. Beyond creating shockwaves with his remarkable acting skills and versatility, effortlessly portraying a range of emotions and drama while excelling in action and dance sequences, Big B redefined stardom in India, earning admirers nationwide, transcending language barriers. The characters tailored specifically for him to fit the â€˜angry young manâ€™ archetype, left a profound mark on various film industries across India, paving the way for regional endeavours to replicate similar movies, catapulting local stars to greater heights. Yet, no one could replicate what Bachchan achieved.

"With a couple of exceptions, picking the best films in a year like this becomes a matter of oneâ€™s preferences among the almost-theres. This is a year defined by various strands emerging from within Telugu cinema complicating any reductive readingâ€”indie dramas rooted in rural Telangana broke through with Balagam and Pareshan, mass films attempted to be more experimental with formâ€” Salaar: Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire and Dasara, even big star-vehicles like Bhagwant Kesari and Waltair Veerayya were forced to take the hero down a peg in order to keep the genre relevant.
The most interesting facet was the return of the romanceâ€”the success of films like Sita Ramam last year and Hi Nanna this year perhaps indicates a resurgence in the popular consciousness of a genre that acknowledges something beyond male fantasies and anxieties, a tendency which has defined and circumscribed popular Telugu cinema for too long. A film like Miss Shetty Mister Polishetty stood out precisely because it managed to center an independent woman who refuses to be circumscribed by patriarchy. There was also Nandini Reddyâ€™s Anni Manchi Sakunamule, which featured a woman working to solve her familyâ€™s financial troubles as its protagonist. 2023 also saw the debut of a female filmmaker (woefully underrepresented in Telugu cinema)â€”Puja Kolluru, with Martin Luther King, a remake of the Tamil film Mandela (2021).

"Taapsee Pannu recently opened up about her experience of working with Shah Rukh Khan in the Rajkumar Hirani directorial Dunki. She said that it was a dream that she never thought she would be able to achieve.
In an interview with Pinkvilla, Taapsee said, â€œThis was a dream or a benchmark of sorts that I never thought Iâ€™ll be able to achieve because I really did not keep it in my list. I was like, â€˜This is too good to be true, letâ€™s just not even keep it in my list because if I donâ€™t achieve it, Iâ€™ll keep feeling bad about it.'â€

"Actor Taapsee Pannu recently shared the screen with Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan in Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s latest release, Dunki. Being cast in a film with a prolific director as Hirani at the helm and a co-star as big as Shah Rukh was â€˜surrealâ€™ for Taapsee. In a recent interview, the actor opened up about her casting in the movie and how nobody in the industry believed that she was cast in Dunki.
While speaking to Pinkvilla, Taapsee revealed that Hirani had first contacted her after the release of Anurag Kashyapâ€™s 2018 film Manmarziyaan. He told her how impressed he was with her performance and even called her, along with Vicky Kaushal, to meet him. â€œHe was so sweet to ask, â€˜What is your process?â€™ I never had such kind of interaction with any industry stalwart. It was a surreal feeling,â€ said Taapsee.

"Eight years ago, Steven Spielberg predicted that the superhero movie would one day go â€œthe way of the Westernâ€.
Spielbergâ€™s comments caused a widespread stir at the time. Avengers: The Age of Ultron was then one of the yearâ€™s biggest movies. The following year would bring Captain America: Civil War, Deadpool and Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice. The superhero movie was in high gear, and showing no signs of slowing down.
But Spielbergâ€™s point was that nothing is forever in the movie business. These cycles, Spielberg said, â€œhave a finite time in popular culture.â€ And the maker of E.T., Jurassic Park and Jaws might know a thing or two about the ebbs and flows of pop-culture taste.
ADVERTISEMENT
As 2023 draws to a close, no one is sounding the death knell of the superhero movie. The Walt Disney Co.â€™s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 made $845.6 million worldwide and Sonyâ€™s Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse ($691 million) was one of the most acclaimed films of the year. Marvel is still mightier than any other brand in the business.
But more than ever before, there are chinks in the armor of the superhero movie. Its dominance in popular culture is no longer quite so assured. A cycle may be turning, and a new one dawning.

For the first time in more than two decades, the top three movies at the box office didnâ€™t include one sequel or remake: Barbie, The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Oppenheimer. The last time that happened was 2001, when Harry Potter and the Sorcererâ€™s Stone, Shrek and Monsters, Inc. topped the box office.
No, itâ€™s not exactly a lineup of originality like, say, 1973, when The Exorcist, The Sting and American Graffiti led all movies in ticket sales. Barbie and The Super Mario Bros., based on some of the most familiar brands in the world, will generate spinoffs and sequels of their own.
ADVERTISEMENT
But itâ€™s hard not to sense a shift in moviegoing, one that might have reverberations for years to come for Hollywood.
â€œThereâ€™s an inflection point in 2023,â€ says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. â€œBarbenheimer is just one part of that story. Audiences, they want to be challenged. I think the tried and true is not necessarily working.â€
Greta Gerwigâ€™s Barbie, from Warner Bros., was the yearâ€™s runaway hit, with more than $1.4 billion in ticket sales worldwide. It was a blockbuster like none seen before: an anarchic comedy that set a string of records for a movie directed by a woman.
Nearly as unprecedented was the success of Christopher Nolanâ€™s Oppenheimer, a three-hour drama that nearly grossed $1 billion. As different as it and Barbie were, they were each original feats of cinema and personal statements by its directors.

At the same time, the Walt Disney Co.â€™s Marvel, a hit-making machine like none other in movie history, faltered like never before. The Marvels marked a new low for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, collecting $200 million globally. DC Studios, in the midst of a revamp, saw disappointing results for The Flash and Blue Beetle before watching Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom sink to a $28.1 million debut.
Both Marvel and DC have already made moves to right their ships. Bob Iger, Disneyâ€™s chief executive, has called turning around Marvel his top priority. He said the superhero studio has suffered greatly from too many films and series leading to â€œdiluted qualityâ€. The James Gunn, Peter Safran-led DC, meanwhile, wonâ€™t officially launch until 2025 with Superman Legacy.
In the meantime, something else will have to fill the void. That was a theme in 2023, too, when the writers and actors strikes marred release plans and forced the delay of several films including Warnerâ€™s Dune: Part Two, Sonyâ€™s next Ghostbusters movie and MGMâ€™s Challengers.
Those disruptions will continue in 2024. Analysts arenâ€™t expecting a banner year for Hollywood in part because films like the next Mission: Impossible film and the Spider-Verse sequel, both delayed by the strikes, wonâ€™t make their original dates.
ADVERTISEMENT
Overall ticket sales in U.S. and Canadian theaters for 2023 are expected to reach about $9 billion, according to Comscore, an improvement of about 20% from 2022. The industry is still trying to regain its pre-pandemic footing, when ticket sales regularly surpassed $11 billion. Output of wide-releases in 2023 (88) still trailed those in 2019 (108) by 18.5%.
Hollywood is still coaxing moviegoers back to theaters â€” something Barbie, Oppenheimer and Mario went a long way to helping.
â€œIt reinforced something that weâ€™ve known for 100 years in the business: People like going to the shared experience out of the home,â€ says Jeffrey Goldstein, distribution chief for Warner Bros. â€œThey love being entertained. Movies are a good financial proposition and can bring in a mass audience.â€
â€œIt probably started with Mario last April,â€ adds Goldstein. â€œI think that showed audiences again that theaters are a fun place to be to. And it showed studios and content creators: Up your game.â€
ADVERTISEMENT
If 2023 is any guide, hits will come from increasingly unpredictable places.
That was the case with Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, a film released just two months after Swiftâ€™s recorded concerts in a first-of-its-kind distribution deal with AMC Theatres. It grossed $250 million worldwide, and was followed by the similarly released Renaissance: A Film by BeyoncÃ©, another No. 1 debut.
More surprising was Sound of Freedom, a $15 million film from the independent Angel Studios, which matched Swift with $250 million worldwide. It was released with a unique â€œpay it forwardâ€ program that allowed people to donate tickets.
Going into 2023, no one was betting Sound of Freedom would outgross The Marvels or that Five Nights at Freddyâ€™s would have a bigger opening weekend than Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œThere are going to be examples of big-budget, traditional blockbusters that do well,â€ says Dergarabedian. â€œBut for every one of those, there have been two that failed. An audience thatâ€™s finding a lot of interesting material on streaming is becoming more open to films like Godzilla Minus One, Indian cinema, Japanese anime. Thereâ€™s a shift in audience taste and studios need to get a handle on this.â€
That poses as much of a challenge as an opportunity to studios. If more-of-the-same no longer has quite the same appeal for moviegoers, an industry that for years has depended on sequels, prequels, reboots and remakes to make up the bulk of its profits may require new creativity.
The Western didnâ€™t vanish all at once. After two decades of ubiquity, it began going out of style in the 1960s. And the Western, of course, continues to be rich territory for filmmakers. This year, 81-year-old Martin Scorsese made his first Western in Killers of the Flower Moon, the three-hour-plus $200 million epic from Apple Studios.
The superhero movie, likewise, wonâ€™t ever die. But its heyday might have reached its endgame.

"â€œAndha vinnukum mannukum samandham undunu sonnathu yaar? Adhu mannavan paeru (Who proved there is a bond between heaven and the earth? Itâ€™s our king.â€ Perhaps, this line from Chinna Gounder, in the voice and composition of Ilaiyaraaja, is the song playing in the heads of many across Tamil Nadu today. Actor Ilavarasu, a frequent collaborator of Vijayakanth, while mourning the death of the star, made a valid observation that how irrespective of his success and failures in politics, Vijayakanth remained someone who was never hated by the masses. Almost all celebrities of Tamil Nadu have invariably noted how the actor was a peopleâ€™s champion and helped the downtrodden.
To describe the mindset of Vijayakanth, a viral video of his speech at a public meeting, would help. In the clip, Captain says, â€œWhat is everyone going to do with crores and crores of rupees? Wonâ€™t you all feed me, my wife, and my sons? Wonâ€™t there be a small space for me and my family? Isnâ€™t that enough? If I start spending one day at every one of your homes, I can live through life. What is then money? Even when we are burnt, they take off the arunakodi (a thread tied in the hip in people down South). Am I going to take all of it when I go?â€

"When Hindi film fans heard the slogan chosen by Congress for its campaign for the Lok Sabha Elections 2024, they couldnâ€™t help but sing it in a melody. â€˜Hain Tayyar Humâ€™, the slogan chosen by the Congress is reminiscent of the song of the same name from the 1991 film Hum. Congress held a mega rally dubbed â€˜Hain Tayyar Humâ€™ in Nagpur on Thursday, the partyâ€™s 139th foundation day.
Starring Amitabh Bachchan, Rajinikanth and Govinda in lead roles, Hum was directed by Mukul Anand. â€˜Hain Tayyar Humâ€™ was the title song of the film and was used as a family song in the film with the characters standing up united in the face of adversity. The film also starred Kimi Katkar, Deepa Sahi, Shilpa Shirodkar, Danny Denzongpa, Anupam Kher and Kader Khan, and was one of the most successful films of the year.

"In a career spanning five decades, veteran actor Ranjeet has starred in over 500 films. He remains best known for playing negative characters. In his recent interview with Radio Nasha, Ranjeet spoke about the time his family didnâ€™t approve of his career choices, and even threw him out of the house. The actor had to ask his co-star Rakhee to talk to his mother on his behalf.
Ranjeet played a negative role in the 1971 film Sharmeelee. In the film, a scene showed him assaulting Rakheeâ€™s character. Seeing this, Ranjeetâ€™s family walked out of the theatre, and later, asked the actor to leave the house. Recalling the story, he said in Hindi, â€œMy mother said, â€˜How dare you enter this house? You tear womenâ€™s clothes, what kind of work is this?â€™ She told me to get out of the house.â€

"Dunki actor Vikram Kochhar spoke about the the filmâ€™s box office clash against Prabhasâ€™ Salaar, and said that art isnâ€™t something that should be pitted against itself. He also spoke about the rise in male-driven action films, a genre that has dominated Indian theatres this year, with films such as Pathaan, Jawan, Gadar 2, Leo, Jailer and most recently, Animal, delivering huge numbers.
In an interview with Bollywood Now, the actor speculated that the masses in India are angry, frustrated, and vengeful, which is perhaps why they are turning to this kind of cinema over more sensitive stories. â€œThere are a lot of action-thrillers that are working these days, and a lot of people want to watch them. But this also depends on the political scenario of a given time. Look at how many wars are going on around the world. People are frustrated, angry, hateful, these feelings are prevalent. Everybody has vengeance in their heart, but they donâ€™t think about where this will take them,â€ he said.

"â€˜Captainâ€™ is among many other titles like â€˜Puratchi Kalaingarâ€™ that have gone viral on social media after the demise of actor-politician Vijayakanth. While other names like Karuppu MGR and Sokka Thangam do justice to the actor, nothing comes close to Captain. It was accepted not only by his fans but the masses, who never found a reason to hate him. However, a case was filed against Vijayakanth for using the moniker as it is a title given only to soldiers in Indian armed forces.

An ex-serviceman named Dhandapani filed the complaint at the Madras High Court saying that it was illegal to use the title as Vijayakanth has never served in the Indian Army. A Times of India report from 2014, quoted Dhandapani as saying, â€œHe is an actor. To my knowledge, he never served the Indian Army but he has been using the term â€˜captainâ€™ in a fraudulent manner. It is illegal and an insult to the honor and respect of the Indian Army.â€

"Actor Vikram Kochhar, who recently appeared in Shah Rukh Khanâ€˜s Dunki, spoke about how different the experience was as compared to working with Akshay Kumar on the film Kesari. In Dunki, directed by Rajkumar Hirani, Vikram played the character Balinder â€˜Bugguâ€™ Lakhanpal, who is a part of the core group of friends of Shah Rukhâ€™s character Hardy.
In an interview with Home Bollywud, Vikram praised Shah Rukh dedication to his projects, and said that he is completely devoted to his scripts and loves rehearsing scenes until he knows them like the back of his hand. As an actor, he said, it was more fulfilling to work on Dunki. Asked to highlight the differences between the two sets, and to confirm if the reports about Akshay preferring to work early in the morning are true, he said, â€œDiscipline is something that is maintained on every set, and entire teams of people are responsible to maintain the discipline. There isnâ€™t much of a different in terms of working style. They give their shots when they have to, they give cues when they have to. Yes, itâ€™s true that Shah Rukh gives his own cues. Itâ€™s not like that with Akshay sir. Sometimes he gives cues himself, but other times, his double fills in.â€

He said that Shah Rukhâ€™s younger son, AbRam, had baked a cake for the guests, and also remarked about how lived-in Mannat felt. Vikram appears in the film as Balinder â€˜Bugguâ€™ Lakhanpal, a member of the core group of friends that Shah Rukhâ€™s Hardy hangs out with in Punjab.
Vikram said that he was invited to Mannat after being cast in the film, and the magnitude of the moment wasnâ€™t lost on him, especially when he noticed crowds outside the Mumbai landmark. He said that only some years ago, he was a member of the same crowds, and he couldnâ€™t help but feel proud at being invited inside the propertyâ€™s doors.

"Many videos about actor-politician Vijayakanth are going viral on social media after his death on Thursday at MIOT Hospital, Chennai. One such video is a clip from actor Vijayâ€™s old interview; the reigning Tamil superstar played a supporting role in Vijayakanthâ€™s Sendhoorapandi (1993). Directed by Vijayâ€™s father SA Chandrasekar, a frequent collaborator of Vijayakanth, the film ended up as a hit, helping Vijay get popular among the masses.

"Saif Ali Khan said that contrary to popular belief, he doesnâ€™t own a chalet in Gstaad, and nor does his ancestral Pataudi Palace have seven billiards rooms. Saif cleared a couple of misconceptions about himself on the latest episode of Koffee with Karan, on which he was joined by his mother, Sharmila Tagore. On the episode, Saif also narrated an anecdote about his son, Taimur.
He said that Taimur has developed an interest in Christianity, after being introduced to the religion by Kareena Kapoor. But since Kareena doesnâ€™t answer his questions, the responsibility has fallen on Saif. â€œHe keeps asking me questions about God. And I have to figure out how to answer them properly. He was asking something about the crucifixion, and how Jesus died, and why he was killed. It needs a proper answer.â€ Karan joked, â€œThank God he isnâ€™t asking Bebo that, because I donâ€™t want her to give him wrong information, which sheâ€™s capable ofâ€¦â€

"Sharmila Tagore appeared to reveal that she has been diagnosed with cancer, on the latest episode of Koffee with Karan. While talking about why she couldnâ€™t play a supporting role in Karan Joharâ€™s Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, Sharmila said that she was concerned about her health at the time. Karan said that he regrets not being able to work with her on the film, which went on to become a major critical and commercial success.
The role in question eventually went to Shabana Azmi. In the movie, Shabana plays the grandmother of Alia Bhattâ€™s character, and has her own parallel romantic track with Dharmendraâ€™s character. â€œIâ€™d offered Sharmila ji the part played by Shabana ji, she was my very first choice. But because of health reasons at that time, she couldnâ€™t say yes. It is a regret I have,â€ Karan said.

"Kareena Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan started dating in 2007 and have been together for 16 years now and on the latest episode of Koffee with Karan with guests Sharmila Tagore and Saif Ali Khan, Kareena appeared in a video and spoke about her love for Saif. Kareena also remembered that moment that she fell for Saif.
â€œWhat does Saif mean to me? Saif is my entire being, my entire universe, my whole life revolves around my Saif. My eyes well up every time I talk about him because he is my life,â€ she said as she got emotional. Kareena then recalled her favourite memory of Saif and shared, â€œMy favourite memory will always be the first time I met Saif. Because he was sitting on top of a makeup vanity van in Ladakh without his t-shirt and I was like â€˜who is that guy who is sitting on op of a vanity van?â€™ and they were like â€˜itâ€™s Saif and I looked closer and I was like â€˜my god, thatâ€™s Saifâ€™. That was the moment I lost my mind and that was it.â€

"The latest episode of Koffee With Karan 8 featured Saif Ali Khan and his mother, veteran actor Sharmila Tagore, as they shared various untold stories from their personal lives. In a specific segment, Saif candidly discussed his vibrant dating experiences in college, recounting how he once skipped university in Dublin for a date with an air hostess. Additionally, he revealed his initial days in Mumbai, staying at the house of writer and poet Gulzar sahab, which led to Gulzarâ€™s daughters, Meghna Gulzar, being moved out of the house.
When Karan asked Sharmila if Saif was a brat growing up, she said, â€œI wouldnâ€™t say he was a brat but he caused anxiety all around. I never quite knew what he was up to. Once he was playing bows and arrows with his cousin and the tip of the arrow went into his eye, his cornea gotâ€¦Now everybody that looks at him says that there is a scar there.â€ Saif chimed in, â€œI couldnâ€™t see out of one eye properly and people would say that I am copying my father because my father couldnâ€™t see out of one eye.â€

"Saif Ali Khan was just 21 years old when he got married to actor Amrita Singh, and it was only after they tied the knot that he told his family members about it. On the latest episode of Koffee with Karan, Saif and his mother, veteran actor Sharmila Tagore, revisited this time in Saifâ€™s life and recalled how he broke the news to the family. Saif shared that Sharmila was â€˜hurtâ€™ and â€˜started cryingâ€™ after he told her, because she expected to be involved in these matters.
Sharmila recalled that she was in Mumbai when Saif came to meet her and broke the news in person. â€œHe said, â€˜I have something to tell youâ€™, and then he told me. I donâ€™t know what I was doing, but I was quiet, and he says, â€˜Amma, your colour is changing, you are looking different.â€™ I said, â€˜Well okay, we will talk about it later, not nowâ€™. After he left, I rang Tiger and told him. There was also a long silence there. We left it at that and then I said, â€˜I would like to meet herâ€™,â€ she said.

"Despite facing stiff competition from the Prabhas-starrer Salaar, Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Dunki has maintained a steady pace at the box office. However, after making the most of its first weekend and the Christmas holiday period, Dunki has witnessed a consistent decline in revenue. According to early estimates by industry tracker Sacnilk, Dunki is expected to earn Rs 9.75 crore on Wednesday, marking the filmâ€™s lowest single-day haul. This will bring the filmâ€™s total domestic collection to Rs 151.26 crore.
On Wednesday, Dunki had an overall 19.89 percent Hindi occupancy. After seven days, Dunki accumulated Rs 305 crore in worldwide gross box office, as shared by Red Chillies Entertainment on X (formerly Twitter).

"Salaar: Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire, starring Prabhas and Prithviraj Sukumaran in the lead roles, had a historic start at the Indian box office. The film made Rs 90.7 crore nett on its opening day in India, but even after such a massive start, the filmâ€™s collections have seen a steady drop in subsequent days. The long weekend over the Christmas holidays helped the filmâ€™s box office numbers. After collecting Rs 24.9 crore on Tuesday, the film earned Rs 17 crore on Wednesday, its sixth day of release. This takes Salaarâ€™s nett domestic collection to Rs 297.40 crore, as per industry tracker Sacnilk.
This seems like a win for Prabhas, whose previous film, the much-hyped Adipurush, could only manage to make Rs 288.15 crore nett in India through the course of its run. Adipurush ran into controversy soon after its release and was criticised for its visual effects and dialogues. His 2022 film Radhe Shyam, earned only Rs 104.38 crore nett during its run. Salaar will cross the lifetime collection of Prabhasâ€™ 2019 film, Saaho, on its seventh day. Saaho made Rs 310.60 crore through its run. His biggest hit to date is SS Rajamouliâ€™s Baahubali 2: The Conclusion, which made Rs 1030.42 crore nett in India and grossed Rs 1788.06 crore globally.

"Is it even a joke if you have to explain it? But thatâ€™s what Ricky Gervais repeatedly does in his new Netflix special, Armageddon. Essentially a cover version of his greatest hits, the hourlong special finds the comedian taking particular delight in essentially committing an act of onstage arson. Gervais tackles everything from dying babies to dwarf actors, from China to chimpanzees. â€œYouâ€™ll realise this is great satire when Iâ€™m dead,â€ he says at the end of a particularly hilarious bit about ordering a pair of track bottoms off Amazon.
His recurring schtick in Armageddon is to keep telling the audience that heâ€™s still workshopping the material, implying that some of the jokes havenâ€™t yet been perfected. Itâ€™s all a part of the act, of course, even the extended break-downs. The bigger question is, why? Why, after all these years, does Gervais feel the need to underline every point that he is making? The simplest answer is that, in his attempt to spell things out, he is satirising his audienceâ€™s dwindling appetite for risquÃ© humour.

"Despite the challenges faced by Malayalam cinema in 2023, especially in terms of business, where nearly 90 per cent of films reportedly struggled to eke out a profit in theatres, it would be unfair to label the year as entirely negative for the industry. The presence of a few highly memorable films, showcasing exceptional narratives and featuring outstanding performances, provided audiences and the industry with some respite.
Moreover, 2023 also saw many actors pushing the limits and embracing roles considered unconventional â€” from Mammootty and Joju George to Darshana Rajendran and Aju Varghese, the list of actors who excelled in out-of-the-box performances is not short.

"A complaint was filed at a police station here on Wednesday against Bollywood actor Ranbir Kapoor and his family members for allegedly hurting religious sentiments over a viral video showing them celebrating Christmas.
No First Information Report (FIR) has been registered in the case yet.
WATCH: Ranbir Kapoor says â€˜Jai Mata Diâ€™ as he cuts a cake at Kapoorsâ€™ Christmas lunch
ADVERTISEMENT
Sanjay Tiwari, who filed the complaint at Ghatkopar police station through his lawyers Ashish Rai and Pankaj Mishra, claimed that in the video Ranbir is seen pouring liquor on cake and setting it on fire while saying â€œJai Mata Diâ€.
In Hinduism, fire god is invoked before invoking other deities, but Ranbir Kapoor and his family members deliberately used intoxicants while celebrating the festival of another religion and chanted â€œJai Mata Diâ€, the complaint said.
This hurt the complainantâ€™s religious sentiments, it alleged.

"Subhash Ghaiâ€™s 1991 film Saudagar was considered the biggest casting coup at the time as it starred Dilip Kumar and Raaj Kumar for the first and only time. Ghai took the credit for bringing the stars together as they were rumoured to be on not-such-great terms off-screen. However, while Ghai scored big with the audience for bringing the actors together, Govind Namdev, who was also a part of the film, felt that he was shortchanged here. In a recent interview, Govind said that it was a â€œtraumatic timeâ€ for him as Ghai shot with him but later removed his character from the film altogether.
â€œThat was a traumatic time for me,â€ Govind told Lehren Retro. â€œWhen I got the role, it was quite big and then he later chopped off the entire role in the final edit. By then, I had already told the entire world that I was working with Dilip Kumar, Raaj Kumar, Subhash Ghai. These are big personalities. I had told everybody about it. The shoot was also done,â€ he shared.

"Actor Sajid Khan, who played the younger version of Sunil Duttâ€™s Birju in Mehboob Khanâ€™s Mother India and later rose to prominence with international projects such as Maya and The Singing Filipina, has died following a battle with cancer. Khan was in his early 70s.
â€œHe had been battling cancer for a while. He passed away on Friday (December 22),â€ the actorâ€™s son Sameer told PTI.
According to Sameer, his father had settled in Kerala with his second wife.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œMy father was adopted by Rajkumar Pitamber Rana and Sunita Pitamber and fostered by filmmaker Mehboob Khan. He was not active in films for a while and was mostly involved in philanthropy. He used to come to Kerala quite often and he liked it here, remarried, and settled here,â€ Sameer added.
The actor was laid to rest at the Kayamkulam Town Juma Masjid in Keralaâ€™s Alappuzha district.
After Mother India, which was nominated for the Oscars, Sajid Khan played the titular role in Mehboob Khanâ€™s Son of India.
Khan found global stardom as a teen idol with his role in Maya where he played the role of a local boy Raji, who befriends the character played by Jay North. The movieâ€™s popularity led to a series of the same name and added to Khanâ€™s popularity.

"Vijay Sethupathi and Katrina Kaif will soon be seen together in Sriram Raghavanâ€™s Merry Christmas. In a recent promotional interview for the movie, Katrina revealed that Vijay did not speak to her much during the filming. She said that after talking to Varun Dhawan, who has worked with Sriram in Badlapur, she came to the conclusion that maybe the director had instructed him to not speak with her but Vijay had another story to tell. The Farzi actor said that he didnâ€™t speak to the Tiger 3 star because he was intimidated by her.
Katrina shared that Vijay is â€œvery philosophical and he is very very wiseâ€ and added that â€œhe is not a big conversationalist, at least on the film.â€ The actor then shared that she really liked working in the film but found it strange that people were not talking to her on set. â€œI came to know later that Sriram sir possibly told people that they should not talk too much to me on set. Varun Dhawan told this to me. He was asking, â€˜Whatâ€™s it like working with Sriram sir?â€™ I said, â€˜He is amazing, his world is amazing but nobody talks too much to me on set.â€™ I was really questioning myself. He said, â€˜Donâ€™t worry, he has told everyone not to talk to you.â€™ I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s true,â€ she shared while talking to Pinkvilla.

"More than 50 French performers, writers and producers published an essay Tuesday defending film star and national icon Gerard Depardieu amid growing scrutiny of his behavior toward women during his five-decade career. Advocates for sexual abuse victims expressed dismay at the outpouring of support.
Depardieu was handed preliminary rape and sexual assault charges in 2020 following allegations from actor Charlotte Arnould, and has been accused by more than a dozen other women of harassing, groping or sexually assaulting them. Depardieu denies wrongdoing, and called the essay â€˜â€beautifulâ€.
Published Tuesday in the conservative-leaning Le Figaro, it was signed by figures including former first lady and singer Carla Bruni, Depardieuâ€™s former partner Carole Bousquet, and actors Pierre Richard, Charlotte Rampling and Victoria Abril. Two dozen of the 56 signatories were women. Many are from Depardieuâ€™s generation; he is 74.
ADVERTISEMENT
A recent documentary outlined accusations of sexual misconduct by 16 women against Gerard Depardieu, and showed the actor making obscene remarks and gestures during a 2018 trip to North Korea. The France-2 documentary prompted calls by some to stop airing Depardieuâ€™s films, which include classics of modern French cinema.
In response, Tuesdayâ€™s essay says: â€œWe cannot remain silent in the face of the lynching targeting him, the torrent of hate being dumped on his personality.
â€œWhen Gerard Depardieu is targeted this way, it is the art (of cinema) that is being attacked,â€™â€™ it said. â€œFrance owes him so much. â€¦ Depriving ourselves of this immense actor would be a drama, a defeat. The death of the art. Our art.â€™â€™
Paris lawmaker and feminist RaphaÃ«lle RÃ©my-Leleu said the signatories are experiencing a â€˜â€™denial of realityâ€.â€™ She said she would have preferred for them to support initiatives against sexual violence instead.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œThey are refusing to see what this man did â€¦ because he is an artist,â€³ she told broadcaster France-Info.
Emmanuelle Dancourt, whose #MeTooMedia group supports sexual misconduct victims in the media industry, said on BFM television that the essayâ€™s message is particularly painful for victims of sexual abuse by powerful men.
French President Emmanuel Macron also drew ire when he said last week that Gerard Depardieu â€™â€™makes France proudâ€.
The recent documentary includes a segment where Depardieu is heard making crude sexual comments about a young girl riding a horse. Macron suggested that the segment could have been edited in a misleading way. France Televisions, which broadcast the documentary, later said that the segment in question was authenticated by a bailiff who viewed the raw footage."
"Katrina Kaif, Vijay Sethupathi and Sriram Raghavan are currently promoting their upcoming film Merry Christmas. In a recent interview, Katrina shared that she recently realised that she still canâ€™t decide if she should be addressing Vijay as â€˜sirâ€™ or not. Katrina said that she and her husband Vicky Kaushal even googled the actorâ€™s age to decide how she should address him.
â€œOn the car over here, I was talking to Vicky and I said Vijay sirâ€¦ And he said, â€˜Aap Vijay sir bulate hain? (You call him Vijay sir?)â€™ I said sometimes i do, and sometimes I donâ€™t,â€ she told Pinkvilla and then asked Vijay who was sitting on the same panel, â€œShould I be calling you Vijay sir or Vijay?â€

"Sriram Raghavanâ€™s Merry Christmas, which stars Katrina Kaif and Vijay Sethupathi in the lead roles, made the audience curious as soon as the star cast of the film was announced. In a recent chat, Sriram said that he was thrilled about this casting but before he brought Sethupathi on board, there was another actor who had shown his interest in the part and that actor was Saif Ali Khan. However, Sriram had to refuse Saif because he â€œwanted something freshâ€.
Talking to Pinkvilla, Sriram said that he â€œwanted a very unique kind of pairing because thatâ€™s the story requirement.â€ â€œOne should not get any baggage from either of them that what are these people about and so on,â€ he shared. After the director cast Katrina in the lead role, he met Saif for the role of the male lead but later decided that he wouldnâ€™t be right for the part. â€œI had met another actor who had liked the role also. Then I told him sorry I want toâ€¦ because he had worked with her before,â€ the director said.

"Prabhas is concluding the year 2023 on a high note with his latest film, Salaar: Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire, breaking many box office records. After surpassing Jawan to become the biggest opener of 2023, Salaar has, however, experienced a gradual decline in its collections. According to early estimates by industry tracker Sacnilk, posted at 6 pm, the film has amassed a nett collection of Rs 11.24 crore in India on Wednesday, bringing its total domestic earnings to an impressive Rs 291.54 crore.
Salaarâ€™s global collection stands at Rs 428.9 crore. Despite starting its run with an impressive Rs 90.7 crore in India, the film saw a drop to Rs 56.35 crore on Saturday. It showed growth on Sunday by minting Rs 62.05 crore. However, on Monday, which coincided with the Christmas holiday, the collections fell by 25.38%, and the film earned Rs 46.3 crore. On Tuesday, a working day, the film witnessed a 46 percent drop, raking in just Rs 24.9 crore. Further drop in collection is expected on Wednesday.
Despite releasing with Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Dunki, the Prabhas-starrer maintained an upper hand in terms of box office collections. The SRK-starrer, which released a day earlier than Salaar, has garnered Rs 140.20 crore in India till date. Salaar is now eyeing to surpass the record set by Rajinikanthâ€™s film Jailer, which became the only South Indian film this year to reach the milestone of Rs 600 crore worldwide.

Hombale Films, the production house behind Salaar, recently announced they have lowered the ticket rates for the film in prominent cinema chains across India. This move is expected to fetch more footfalls in the coming days.

"Actor Abhishek Bachchan said that he isnâ€™t one to complain when films do well at the box office, because ultimately, thatâ€™s what the industry needs. But, he said, on a purely mathematic level, the biggest hit of the year wasnâ€™t Jawan or Pathaan, but probably director Vidhu Vinod Chopraâ€™s sleeper hit, 12th Fail. Abhishek was participating in a roundtable discussion with 12th Fail actor Vikrant Massey, where they were both asked about the resurgence of Bollywood in 2023, which has been fronted by a slew of hyper-masculine â€˜films.
The biggest Hindi-language hits of the year are Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Pathaan and Jawan, the Sunny Deol-starrer Gadar 2, and Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s Animal. But 12th Fail quietly ended up making nearly Rs 70 crore worldwide, despite being released in a fraction of the screens as some of the bigger films. Abhishek took the opportunity to explain how the business functions, and said that the marketplace isnâ€™t conducive for smaller films, which are often held to the same standards as the big blockbusters.

Shah Rukh took to X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday and chatted with his fans via an #AskSRK session.
When one of his fans asked how he deals with the â€˜nonsenseâ€™ that is written about him, and if the opinions of other people bothers him, the actor said that he would rather â€œwork on beliefâ€ instead of listening to everyoneâ€™s opinion. Shah Rukh was asked, â€œHow do you not react when you see nonsense written about you? Before it was magazines and news but now everyone has an opinion? Does it affect u or u are unbothered? #AskSRKâ€. The actor replied, â€œHa ha u have heard the saying â€˜opinions are like ______s, everyone has one!â€™ I work on belief not on opinions my friend. #Dunkiâ€

"Ever since Munawar Faruquiâ€™s rumored girlfriend Ayesha Khan entered the Bigg Boss 17 house, there has been a cold war between her and Mannara Chopra. Even Mannaraâ€™s equation with Munawar has been affected, and this bottling up of emotions seems to be now taking a toll on Mannara. In the last few episodes, we have seen her getting into bickering with Ayesha. Another evident thing is that two groups have been formed in the house now, and looks like things are not getting any better.
In the latest promo of Bigg Boss 17, Mannara is seen having a conversation with Munawar over him defending Ayesha. While the Lock Upp 1 winner is seen telling her not to pick on Ayesha, the South actor is in no mood to budge.

"One of the most successful stars that Hindi film industry has seen, Salman Khan is a brand in himself today. As the actor, fondly called Bhai by his fans, is celebrating his 58th birthday today. However, Salmanâ€™s initial days in the film industry were not smooth despite being writer Salim Khanâ€™s son. Earlier this year, Salman Khan reflected on his struggle before finding success in the film industry.
Speaking at a recent press conference before the release of his film Tiger 3, he had shared, â€œPeople say that we will put in all the work after we get the film. All these things, I have done much before I came into the industry. The four-five years of struggle that I had before I came into the industry, before I did films like Maine Pyar Kiya and Biwi Ho To Aisi. After that also, whenever I sign a movie, I have to like it in the first narration. If I like a film, I shift that film before my other projects. And the projects that I have postponed, they will likely not happen. Until that time, I wonâ€™t sign another film. That is what I usually concentrate on.â€

"Pranay Reddy Vanga, who served as a producer on his brother Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€˜s new film, Animal, said that Rashmika Mandanna has not received due appreciation for her performance in the film. He also noted how Triptii Dimriâ€™s cameo appearance has attracted more attention, and said that at the end of the day, â€˜the wife is the wife, girlfriend is the girlfriendâ€™, implying that Triptii can never replace Rashmika as the filmâ€™s female lead, despite the skewed interest.
Chatting with iDreamMedia, Pranay said that the criticism against Animal has mostly come from the English-speaking critics in Mumbai, while the Telugu media has been mostly lenient. â€œThereâ€™s a gang forming,â€ he said, â€œThey want to bring him down.â€ Asked why anybody would want that, Pranay added, â€œFirst thing is, heâ€™s a South Indian guy coming to Mumbai, dictating terms there.â€ Absolving Bhushan Kumar and T-Series of any suspicion, Pranay continued, â€œThese English-speaking critics are far from reality. They should travel from Kashmir to Kanyakumari in a second-class coach to see what people are going throughâ€¦ Canâ€™t do much.â€

"Salaar box office collection: An out-and-out Prabhas film, Salaar: Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire has been a rage at the box office since its release on December 22. However, the action-thriller has also been witnessing a steady drop in revenue. After starting its run with an impressive Rs 90.7 crore in India, the film dropped to Rs 56.35 crore on Saturday. It showed slight growth on Sunday (Rs 62.05 crore). But on Monday, which also happened to be the Christmas holiday, the collections fell by 25.38% and the film earned Rs 46.3 crore.
Now on its fifth day, its first working weekday, the Prashanth Neel film raked in Rs 23.50 crore, according to industry tracker Sacnilk. This is less than the Tuesday figures for this yearâ€™s biggest blockbuster, Jawan, which earned Rs 39.1 crore on its fifth day in the theatres. Even Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s Animal did better business than Salaar on its fifth day, as it earned Rs 37.47 crore. Sunny Deolâ€™s Gadar 2, on the other hand, made Rs 55.4 crore on the fifth day.

"Salman Khan, the name has been synonymous with Bollywood for almost three decades now â€” some know him as the superstar, for others he is the â€˜Bhaiâ€™ they love to emulate IRL. In his 35-year career as an actor, Salman has led over a hundred films, most of which have turned out to be box office successes. One of the troika of Bollywoodâ€™s Khans, Salman has ridden epic crests and touched deep troughs but managed to retain a massive fanbase. However, the last few years have been lacklustre for Salman with films failing at the box office and the touchstone of public acclaim. While the filmsâ€™ report card has not blemished the actorâ€™s starpower, is it time for reinvention for Salman Khan?
Today, on Salman Khanâ€™s birthday, we speak to filmmakers and industry experts to understand what is that people expect from the star and how he can reinvent himself a la Shah Rukh Khan circa 2023.

"Itâ€™s a strange scene, but Ananya Panday saves it. Strange because, unlike the rest of the film (which is surprisingly sombre and not averse to simmering in sadness), this scene unfolds like a farce â€” complete with an over-the-top tone, garish set dressing, and broad humour. And it becomes Pandayâ€™s responsibility to to rein it in. The movie in question, of course, is Kho Gaye Hum Kahan, a coming-of-age drama that will make everybody with a fast-depleting Cult Fit membership feel seen. But weâ€™ll get to that later.
First, Panday. The young actor is often cited as the foremost example of blatant nepotism â€” the sort of nepotism that makes a certain section of the audience raise their pitchforks and orchestrate boycotts on social media. She isnâ€™t, for instance, slotted alongside Babil Khan, despite being being considerably captivating on screen. In Kho Gaye Hum Kahan, sheâ€™s often jostling for space alongside the equally talented Siddhant Chaturvedi and Adarsh Gourav, but your attention invariably ends up being drawn to her. That has to count for something, right?"
"Streaming platforms have been hamstrung by over-reliance on Bollywood biggies, and it was never as evident as it was in 2023, when some of the yearâ€™s weakest web shows came out riding on the coat-tails of these worthies.

"Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Animal attracted a lot of controversy for its misogynistic and violent content but the Ranbir Kapoor-starrer has emerged as one of the biggest hits of the year. Sandeepâ€™s brother Pranay Reddy Vanga, who is also a co-producer of Animal, recently shared that back when Sandeep was still trying to bag his first Telugu film, he was told that â€œhe should go to Bollywoodâ€ as his ideas were seen as too bold for Telugu cinema.
In a chat with Pinkvilla, Pranay said that after passing out of his film school in Australia, when Sandeep returned to Hyderabad, he thought he â€œwould crack it easilyâ€ but it did not happen that way. â€œHe thought he would crack it easily after coming from Australia but that wasnâ€™t happening because of the way he was narrating the story. I donâ€™t knowâ€¦ It was beyond the belief system of the producers, the way he was narrating,â€ Pranay told Pinkvilla.

Chalamet, star of films such as Wonka and Dune series, said Dylanâ€™s longtime manager Jeff Rosen gave him access to the lengthy playlist of unreleased songs by the Nobel laureate which were recorded between 1959 and 1964.
The actor, who will be singing in the film, likened the collection of music to â€œgoldâ€.

â€œThis might earn the ire and wrath of a lot of Bob fans, rightfully but he (Rosen) sent me like a 12-hour playlist of unreleased Bob stuff from like 1959 to â€™64. I feel like Iâ€™m holding onto gold or something,â€ Chalamet shared on the Happy Sad Confused podcast.

"Abhishek Bachchan recently highlighted the evolving landscape of Hindi cinema, emphasising the increased integration of realism even in mainstream commercial films. In a recent interaction, the actor discussed the industryâ€™s shift towards finding a balance between realism and fantasy.
During a roundtable discussion hosted by Galatta Plus, Abhishek said, â€œThe biggest change in the industry is that even in mainstream commercial cinema, there is an element of realism which is coming in and how we manage to find that balance between realism with the fantastical is the sweet spot we need to hit. Earlier, you acted for the camera. Today I feel the audience and the actors have been brought up on a steady diet of world cinema. So there is exposure to different type of acting and I feel there is less emphasis on acting for the camera.â€

"Ali Fazal has been a part of many international and Indian projects but the web series that made him a household name was the Amazon Prime Video series Mirzapur. Playing Guddu Pandit in Mirzapur brought Ali a different kind of fame and while on the show, the character first appears to be the kind of man who is only focused on his looks, the audience discovers more about him as the show proceeds. For Ali, it was a challenge to make Guddu a character that isnâ€™t just about his looks.
In a roundtable chat with Zoom, Ali said that at first, everyone was just focused on the looks but he wanted to draw people inside the characterâ€™s head. â€œLike Mirzapur, I thoughtâ€¦ At first everybody is about looks. Like how we should look. And my biggest thing was, I want to run away from that and pull people into this guyâ€™s head. Itâ€™s always fun when you are in my little toy land. Then, I can play. Then, Iâ€™m having fun,â€ he said.

"The promo of Nivin Paulyâ€˜s Malayalee From India reminiscent of Nelson Dilipkumar and Anirudh Ravichaderâ€™s promos for their songs. Nivin and Dijo Jose Antony play the exaggerated versions of themselves in the laugh riot, where the director convinces the actor to star in the film Malayalee From India. The whole promo is intercut between Dijoâ€™s lies about the movie and montages from the actual film. The two are polar opposites. While Nivin is hung up on making a pan-Indian film to keep up with the trend, Dijo seems to have made a hyper-local film.
There are several digs at the pan-Indian movement, Prithviraj Sukumaran, and mostly at Nivin himself in this promo which is creativity at its best.

It took me a while to decide if I should go or not. Finally, I spoke to him and he gave me some courage. Then, I went in,â€ he shared.

"Actor Ali Fazal impressively juggles between his Indian web series and films, and appearances in lucrative Hollywood movies. He was last seen in Vishal Bhardwajâ€™s Khufiya, along with Tabu, and in the West, his last big-screen outing was in the 2022 mystery drama, Death on the Nile.

SRK also spoke about his son Aryan Khan becoming a director and insisted that him and his wife Gauri Khan gave their kids the freedom as to what they wanted to be in their careers.
In a chat with MBC Bollywood, SRK was asked about his kids joining the film industry and he said, â€œItâ€™s double stress. We have more Fridays to look forward to or get anxious about. More thrills of box office and worries and dealing with each other but Iâ€™m happy becauseâ€¦ My son and my daughter are in their 20s so they have kind of seen my life at least for a good 10-12 years as an actor and experienced it firsthand. Maybe there were times when I have reacted to situations as an actor or a star and they have not comprehended it but stood by me, tried to give me solace or celebrated with me without realising the importance of what was happening in my life.â€

He replied, â€œShruti Hasan. Not for posing cause I never asked her, but she was very, very rude to me at an event that I had actually got her into and I donâ€™t even know her! Felt very bad, but there was probably some misunderstanding cause I am good with her husband and I adore him. This will get sorted out in time. However I heard from the rumour mill she called me a â€˜Puneâ€™ like a spot boy or smth.â€

I used to laugh at that and say, â€˜Thatâ€™s misogynistic, I am going to put you in the newspaper,â€™ and he would joke with me about it.â€

Itâ€™s spoken with an earnestness which tells you that the writer and speaker believe that they are saying it for the first time. Or even if they are repeating it, it will hit right with itâ€™s PLU target audience. And donâ€™t be fooled by the broad-based social media schtick: this is a film for the Insta generation by the Insta generation.

"Actor Manoj Bajpayee recently weighed in on the â€˜what is masculinityâ€™ debate that he believes is â€˜instigatedâ€™ by Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s latest hit Animal. The film presents Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s character Ranvijay as an alpha male. Bajpayee said what a film represents depends entirely on a directorâ€™s â€˜gazeâ€™ and the message of a film doesnâ€™t matter if the film is not â€˜engagingâ€™. But he also clarified that he wonâ€™t ever play a character that doesnâ€™t match his conditioning as a human being.
During a recent chat with Zoom, Bajpayee, while answering a question about balancing the layers of a male character in a movie, said, â€œThe film that has instigated this debate about masculinity has a director who believes completely differently. Thatâ€™s his gaze. Joram is another gaze, which is directed by Devashish Makhija and we are in complete agreement with him. His interpretation is that the man doesnâ€™t have a voice and the woman is making decisions for him. When that woman goes away from his life, he becomes voiceless.â€

Orry rose to fame on Instagram, where he regularly posts pictures from high-profile events featuring actors, politicians and businesspersons. In a recent Reddit AMA session, Orry was asked if thereâ€™s anybody that he considers a real friend in the industry, which can be â€˜fakeâ€™ at times.
He said, â€œMy closet from the industry is Janhvi Kapoor, I think JK has part timer as my therapist, my advisor, my teacher, my guru, my life coach, my cheerleader, my support system, etc etc she has always been the real deal to me. Says it how it is and says it with love. There was a time 3 years ago, I hit a very dark rock bottom in my life, and I kid you not, this girl has sat with me on the phone (we were in different countries) and baby sat me for days, weeks, months. Between sets, between meals, between sleep. I would have been so traumatised if I was her, but she is such a strong girl, the life raft of my life. I would not be where I am, or even how happy I am if JK did not have my back, back then and today. I may sound like a suck up/a fan/or even a minion, but idgaf credit where credit is due dude. There has not been a moment I have been conscious, scared, embarrassed to share any detail of my life with her, no matter how low or humiliating it could be.â€

Orry was rumoured to have repeatedly slammed Sara via a decoy account on Reddit, questioning her efforts to appeal to middle India, and criticising her skills as an actor. On Christmas, however, Orry gave a long answer when asked about his â€˜equation with Saraâ€™. He said, â€œLet me tell you something about Sara Ali Khan, we were best friends in college ðŸ¤¢ewðŸ¤®I know right ? And then suddenly we drifted apart over night after we graduated .. but suddenly came back together during lock down where we were attached by the hip and people would say â€˜inseparableâ€™.. shortly after I moved to the UK to farm (yes thatâ€™s true) and she stayed in India to pursue her career in actingâ€¦ and I guess when I came back we were both different people with different motivations and ambitions, on different wavelengths but 100% still dear old friends. There has never been a phone call that she has not picked up of mine and vice versa.â€

While addressing the Christian community, PM Modi said Jesus Christâ€™s life is a message that is centered on compassion and service. â€œChristmas is a day when we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. This is also an occasion to remember his lifeâ€™s message and values. He lived the ideals of kindness and serviceâ€¦ He worked on making an inclusive society that had justice for everyoneâ€¦ These ideals are working as a guiding light for the development journey of our country,â€ PM Modi said.
Prime Minister Modi also praised the contributions of the Christian community to the freedom movement and highlighted the various intellectual thinkers and leaders.

"Actor Manoj Bajpayee admits that he is a changed man after the birth of his daughter Ava, and it is because of her that he recently watched Zoya Akhtarâ€™s Netflix film The Archies. In a new interview, the actor shared the conversation he had with Ava while watching the Suhana Khan and Khushi Kapoor starrer. He also explained why he didnâ€™t like the movie.
Bajpayee, after watching the first 50 minutes of The Archies, told her daughter what he felt about the film, but was surprised that she didnâ€™t like it too. He told Zoom, â€œMy daughter was watching The Archies and I asked her, â€˜How are you liking it?â€™ She was like, â€˜Okayâ€™ and by then I had watched it for 50 minutes. Archies is not a part of my growing up years. My growing-up years included Motu Patlu and Ram Balram. I might have read maybe just one book of Archies and I remember Veronica and Betty.â€

"Internet sensation Orry, aka Orhan Awatramani, held a Reddit AMA session on Christmas, where he answered the most burning questions about Bollywood, and provided gossip to his many followers. Orry spoke about attending Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s grand 58th birthday party this year, and revealed that everybody was hitting on Tania Shroff, who is rumoured to have recently broken up with Ahaan Shetty after years together.
Asked what attending the party was like, Orry euphemistically said that he would love to share some of the best gossip he heard at the bash, but canâ€™t. â€œHonestly, I wish I could tell u guys some gossip from here.. BUT DO U KNOW HOW LONG AND HARD IT IS.. to go people hopping and get my photos âœ‹ðŸ¿â¤ï¸, by the time I was done I was so drunk I donâ€™t even remember what I was saying to half or anyone or anything. However I can tell you that was the first party Tania Shroff attended as single, and boy was / is she in demand ðŸ˜‰all I could see was boys shooting their shots and failing miserably.â€ Asked to describe what Shah Rukh is like, he said, â€œSRK is like a hot knife and we humans are mere pieces of cold butter.

"Actor Abhishek Bachchan looked back at how the film industry has changed in the two-plus decades that heâ€™s been an actor, and said that heâ€™s envious of the time that his nephew, Agastya Nanda, got to prepare before shooting for his first film, The Archies. In an interview, Abhishek said that back in his day, heâ€™d just show up on set and follow the directorâ€™s lead. But, he said, things were even more challenging in his father Amitabh Bachchanâ€™s time.
Speaking at the Galatta Plus Hindi actors roundtable, Abhishek recalled a story that his father once told him about juggling multiple shoots at the same time, and how he was able to pull it off. Abhishek also recalled that the record for the most shifts in a day was set by Shashi Kapoor, who was juggling 11 different projects at the same time at one point. Subsequently, rules were imposed restricting the number of films one actor could do simultaneously.

"Actor Abhishek Bachchan recalled his career beginnings in the Hindi film industry, and how he was â€˜spottedâ€™ by director JP Dutta at an awards function after being rejected by scores of directors over two years. He said that heâ€™d returned to India from college in the United States to be with his father during difficult times â€“ Amitabh Bachchanâ€™s business had just collapsed â€“ and during this time, he started working as a production assistant and assistant director.
But, Abhishek said on the Galatta Plus roundtable featuring Hindi actors, he always wanted to be a movie star. And so, he met several directors, but none of them wanted to take on the responsibility of launching Amitabh Bachchanâ€™s son. Abhishek said that he and his friend decided to write their own script, but even that didnâ€™t take off. One day, Amitabh invited Abhishek to join him at the Filmfare awards, which is where his life changed.

"Dunki Box Office Collection, Day 5: Shah Rukh Khan-led film Dunki box office has benefitted from the long Christmas weekend. The film which started slow, with a collection of Rs 29.2 crore, witnessed a drop on its second day (Rs 20.12 crore), but it gained momentum on Saturday (Rs 25.61 crore) and reached its peak on Sunday and earned more than its opening day (Rs 30.7 crore). On Monday, the Christmas Day, the film again witnessed an impressive footfall despite strong competition from Prabhasâ€™ Salaar.
Dunki day 5 box office collection in India was recorded at Rs 22.50 crore, as reported by industry tracker Sacnilk. The filmâ€™s total domestic collection in five days is Rs 128.13 crore. Red Chillies Entertainment, the production company behind the film, on Tuesday evening shared that Dunki worldwide box office gross is Rs 256.40 crore after five days of release.

"The Prabhas-starrer Salaar: Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire witnessed a bump in box office collections on Christmas Day, as it continued to outperform Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Dunki in India and across the world. Directed by Prashanth Neel, Salaar is estimated to have earned Rs 42 crore on its fourth day of release, passing the crucial Monday test with flying colours, even if it was aided by a holiday. Salaarâ€™s Rs 42 crore Monday haul is bigger than those delivered by Jawan, Leo and Gadar 2 earlier this year, but marginally short of the Rs 43 crore that Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s Animal earned on day four.
Salaar box office collection in India has now passed the Rs 250 crore mark after four days, and is fast approaching the Rs 450 gross mark worldwide. It is now safe to say that Prabhas has finally delivered his long-awaited comeback, after a string of high-profile flops following Baahubali: The Beginning and Baahubali 2: The Conclusion. After starring in those blockbuster films, Prabhas delivered the big-budget flops Saaho, Radhe Shyam and Adipurush."
"Kamar de los Reyes, a television, movie and voice actor best known for playing a gang member-turned-cop in the soap One Life to Live and a villain in the video game Call of Duty: Black Ops II, has died in Los Angeles at 56, the family announced.
De los Reyes died Sunday following a brief battle with cancer, according to a statement from Lisa Goldberg, a publicist for de los Reyesâ€™ wife, Sherri Saum.
In One Life to Live, de los Reyes starred as Antonio Vega, a former gang member who became a lawyer and then a cop, alongside Saum. In the popular video game Call of Duty: Black Ops II, he played the villain Raul Menendez. He also had roles in Foxâ€™s Sleepy Hollow, ABCâ€™s The Rookie and CWâ€™s All American.
ADVERTISEMENT
The family statement said that at the time of his death, de los Reyes was filming All American â€” and had recently shot roles in Marvelâ€™s upcoming Daredevil series and Huluâ€™s yet to be released Washington Black starring Sterling K. Brown.
De los Reyes was born in Puerto Rico and raised in Las Vegas. According to a biography provided by the family, he caught the bug for acting when he arrived in Los Angeles in the late â€™80s. Early roles include playing Pedro Quinn in the 1994 off-Broadway play, Blade to the Heat, and Ferdinand in director George C. Wolfeâ€™s production of The Tempest for Shakespeare in the Park.
On the big screen, de los Reyes appeared in Oliver Stoneâ€™s Nixon, playing Watergate burglar Eugenio Martinez, as a secret service agent in Salt, with Angelina Jolie, and in The Cell with Jennifer Lopez.
â€œDe los Reyes lived in Los Angeles, however, his heart never left Puerto Rico,â€ the family statement said, adding that the actor had been active in the recovery efforts after Hurricane Maria in 2017.

The actor is survived by wife Saum and three sons, Caylen, 26, and twins Michael and John, age 9.

"Looking back at 2023, OTT-wise, itâ€™s clear that in the most crucial manner, the best web series trumped the best movies of the year in the way they were backed by solid, layered, meaningful writing, with proper character arcs and motivations built in.
Kohraa
Just look at â€˜Kohraaâ€™, by far my top show of this year. A brilliant collaboration by Sudeep Sharma, Randeep Jha, Diggi Sisodia and Gunjit Chopra, it used a murder as a peg to hang a compelling character-study in a very specific time and place. The five-part series opens with a body in a fog-laden field in a Punjab village : the discovery leads to seemingly disparate people connected by dark secrets, with a parallel thread of drugs and mobsters. In a great ensemble cast â€“ Suvinder Vicky, Barun Sobti, Manish Chaudhary, Varun Badola, Harleen Sethi, Rachel Shellyâ€“ the former towers over the rest.

"Malayalam cinema kicked off 2023 in style with the highly acclaimed Nanpakal Nerathu Mayakkam, directed by Lijo Jose Pellissery, hitting the screens on January 19. The industry also celebrated Jude Anthany Josephâ€™s 2018: Everyone is a Hero being selected as Indiaâ€™s official entry for the 2024 Oscars, and the film emerged as the highest-grossing Malayalam film of all time.
The Malayalam film scene also witnessed some outstanding, innovative films and actors pushing boundaries and embracing unconventional roles, earning praise from all quarters. However, business-wise, 2023 cannot be labelled as a successful year for the industry.

"What can be the worst moment in a film? A classroom full of characters laughing their hearts out over a joke which is only funny to them. The echo of their laughter gets no response from the audience. Dunki has that momentâ€“ and then some more. You know what the joke is setting out to be, but the punch doesnâ€™t land. You are aware of the drama that is unfolding, but it never tugs. You have seen how high Shah Rukh Khan and Rajkumar Hirani can rise yet are merely settling while watching Dunki, a 2 hour 40-minute heartbreak of a collaboration.
Till about last year, all the year-ender listicles had placed Dunki right in the top 3 of the most anticipated Bollywood films, and rightly so, for it was the fruition of two-decade long attempt to unite Rajkumar Hirani, one of the biggest mainstream Indian directors, and Shah Rukh Khan, in his golden phase. Four days after Dunki, there is a silent disappointment that is ringing through. The film will eventually sink, and there are some valid reasons for this.

"Though Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s Dunki has been unable to create new records at the box office following the release of Prashant Neelâ€™s Prabhas-starrer Salaar: Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire, the Shah Rukh Khan film seems to be gradually gaining traction with the audience. On Sunday, the film recorded a jump of around 20 per cent in the domestic market, raking in Rs 30.7 crore nett.
Meanwhile, renowned filmmaker Hansal Mehta has added his voice to those impressed by Dunki and recently shared a heartfelt tweet praising the comedy drama.

"Actor turned actor Twinkle Khanna took a trip down the memory lane and opened up about why she felt like a â€˜ball of gasâ€™ while filming a song with Shah Rukh Khan for the film Baadshah. The song in question was Mohabbat Ho Gayee in Badshah. Twinkle, who was seen wearing body-hugging outfits, revealed that she was basically starving and surviving on channa (roasted gram) to fit into the outfits.
In a conversation with Shrayana Bhattacharya, Twinkle said, â€œI know you see all these actresses saying that they donâ€™t diet and they eat everything; itâ€™s not true, most of them are starving. I was starving, if you want your stomach to be flat in all those catsuits that we used to wearâ€”I donâ€™t know why we wore them. This was my own brainwave that Iâ€™m going to live on channa. For some reason, being Gujarati, I felt that was also cheap, and you know, I could get it easily wherever I went.â€

"Ghajini is a violent film that puts your mind, ears and all other senses to test. Here, a business tycoon meets a small-time model, falls in love with her, gets hit on the head with a rod, witnesses her murder helplessly and avenges it despite suffering from short-term memory loss.
Led by Aamir Khan, the film by A. R. Murugadoss also features hammers, water taps, iron rods, â€˜ketchupâ€™ blood and an unpleasant, contrived and artificial plot. Of course, everyone loved it 15 years ago when it was released on Christmas day in 2008. Otherwise, how would you justify it becoming the first Hindi movie to earn Rs 100 crore in the domestic market, thus introducing the â€˜covetedâ€™ Rs 100 crore club to judge a filmâ€™s worth? Perhaps, even hinting to budding filmmakers that gory violence, a couple of songs, thumping action-sequences, one sweet love story, and an avenging protagonist would promise a victory at the box office.

  A post shared by Pankaj Tripathi (@pankajtripathi)
The song takes into the world of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a poet who rewrote history. Sung by Jubin Nautiyal, the heart-touching lyrics are penned by Manoj Muntashir and composed by Payal Dev.

â€œI was in a youth wing. I have participated in andolans. I was even jailed for a week! Toh main uss raaste pe nikal chuka tha.hen I realised that the path of politics is full of thorns. Hence, I took a turn and started developing an interest in street theatre. There was Kaildas Rangalaya, Patna where I enrolled myself. Mujhe laga ki yeh behtar hai. Yahaan kam se kam bol ke acting hoti hai ki â€˜main acting kar raha hoonâ€™,â€ Pankaj quipped.

"Despite facing strong competition from Prashanth Neelâ€™s Prabhas-starrer Salaar: Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire and Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s Shah Rukh Khan film Dunki, Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Animal, starring Ranbir Kapoor, continues to attract a substantial audience to the cinema halls. On its 25th day in theatres this Sunday, the action film recorded a domestic nett of Rs 2.18 crore, as reported by industry tracker Sacnilk.

"If Kalki AD 2989 is the next big thing in the Telugu film industry, Malayalam cinema has Malaikottai Valiban. The film brings together Malayalam cinemaâ€™s two greatest talents, Mohanlal and Lijo Jose Pellissery. The director, one of the few who is referred to as an auteur, attained such a state with films like Jallikattu, Ee.Ma.You, and recent Mammootty film, Nanpagal Nerathu Mayakkam. The hype for the film is enormous as fans are waiting to see what he can do with â€˜the complete actorâ€™. Meanwhile, a new poster of the film has been released, creating more intrigue about the film.

"Actor Deepika Deshpande Amin has opened up about working with Shah Rukh Khan in Barry Johnâ€™s theatre group almost 20 years ago. Deepika revealed that SRK was not only energetic but also considerate and generous. She fondly recalled how SRK, who had a van among them all, would make sure to drop every girl to her home at night.
In an interview with Rajshri Unplugged, Deepika said, â€œThe energy he (SRK) had back then, is still there. People talk about his energy, his enthusiasm and how he is always saying â€˜letâ€™s do this, letâ€™s do that.â€™ And he used to help everyone a lot. Whenever we used to do rehearsals, (in theatre) it would get late at night and Shah Rukh was the only person who had a car.â€

"On top of Prabhas, the other major factor contributing to the success of Salaar Part 1: Ceasefire is the set design and the aesthetics of the fictional city Khansaar. As Prashanth Neel said in many interviews before the release of the film, the style of the city was a cross-over between the modern-day world and tribal aestheticsâ€“something similar to the brilliant world of Black Panther. In a new behind-scenes-video released by Hombale Films, we get a glimpse of Khansaarâ€™s making.

"Ever since the release of his film Animal, filmmaker and writer Sandeep Reddy Vanga has often complained about critics and how they have been unfair to his latest blockbuster. In a recent interview, the filmmaker reiterate the same point, emphasizing that films are not a temple of learning and criticised the growing hypersensitivity and wokeness in Mumbai and across the country.
In response to trade analyst Komal Nahtaâ€™s question about the perception that Animal could influence people negatively, Sandeep said, â€œYou are right, a film is not a temple of learning. When they donâ€™t learn in school or from there parents then how will a film teach them? I forgot this and thought that maybe itâ€™s okay to judge a film, but this statement reminded me that itâ€™s wrong. There is a saying that, â€˜if one says a lie many times, it appears to be the truthâ€™ that is what is happening in Mumbai and the whole country. There is too much wokeness. People are getting hyper sensitive. I donâ€™t know why they are so sensitive towards films, they donâ€™t have this reaction in any other department.â€

"â€œThe 90sâ€™ called, they want their films back,â€ is my lingering sentiment as I reflect on the Hindi film landscape of 2023. This year witnessed an onslaught of chest-thumping, ostensibly patriotic films that not only dominated the box office but also transported us back in time. One of these releases was a literal sequel to a 90s hit film, devoid of any contemporary essence. Despite the cinematic offerings of 2023 harking back to the 90s, my recent revisit to Mahesh Bhattâ€™s 1998 film, Zakhm, compelled me to reconsider my stance. This 90s film wasnâ€™t just ahead of its time; it served as a reminder that good films are timeless.
Zakhm draws inspiration from the life of Mahesh Bhattâ€™s mother, Shirin Mohammad Ali, who spent her life yearning for public acknowledgment of her relationship with filmmaker Nanabhai Bhatt. Despite having six children with Shirin, Nanabhai never married her due to their differing religions, subjecting Shirin and her children, including Mahesh Bhatt, to societal judgment. Pooja Bhatt, Mahesh Bhattâ€™s daughter, portrays the character of Noor in the film, inspired by her grandmotherâ€™s challenging life.

"Mike Nussbaum, reputed as the oldest professional actor in America with a prolific stage career and roles in films including Field of Dreams and Men in Black, has died. He was 99.
He died of old age at his Chicago home on Saturday, just days before his 100th birthday, his daughter, Karen Nussbaum, told The Associated Press.
â€œHe was a good father and a good man who raised us to care about other people and respect other people and care about justice,â€ she said.

Check out | Glimpses from Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michael Douglasâ€™ â€˜Christmas eve in Indiaâ€™, see photos
Mike Nussbaum was acknowledged by the Actorâ€™s Equity Association union multiple times in the past several years as the oldest professional actor in the country.
When asked about his status as a working nonagenarian over the years, Nussbaum said he simply enjoyed the work.
â€œI am gifted and lucky to still be able to do the thing that is the most fun for me in life,â€ he told WBEZ Chicago in 2019 when he was 94 years old. â€œAs long as I can do it, I will.â€
Born in December 1923 in Chicagoâ€™s Albany Park neighbourhood, Nussbaum first acted in summer camps. He didnâ€™t pursue acting full-time until he was in his 40s, working for a time as an exterminator. He received his Equity card in the 1970s.

Nussbaum spent more than 50 years on stages in the Chicago area, including at the Chicago Shakespeare Theater. He played Shylock in a 2005 production of The Merchant of Venice and Gremio in The Taming of the Shrew, among many other roles.
In 1984, he won a Drama Desk Award for his performance in David Mametâ€™s Glengarry Glen Ross, which won a Pulitzer Prize the same year. Nussbaum worked with Mamet often over the years.

Nussbaum performed into his 90s, including a 2017 role as Albert Einstein in the play Relativity at Northlight Theatre in suburban Skokie, where he also served briefly as artistic director.
â€œHis genius was that you couldnâ€™t tell he was acting,â€ said BJ Jones, a longtime friend and colleague who is current artistic director at Northlight. â€œHis level of truth was unparalleled. You never saw him sweat. He wasnâ€™t trying to draw attention to himself. â€ Though he was primarily a stage actor, his film credits included a school principal in Field of Dreams and in Men in Black as Gentle Rosenberg, whose head opens during a pivotal scene to reveal a small alien creature.

"One common element in most of the recent films â€” from John Wooâ€™s Silent Night to Prashanth Neelâ€™s Salaarâ€“is the explicit violence, blood, and deaths. Earlier, Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s Animal faced criticism for being too graphic when it comes to fight sequences, and now, Prabhas-Prithviraj starrer Salaar Part 1: Ceasefire is receiving similar reaction. When asked about the violence, Prithviraj Sukumaran, who has played a lead role in the film, defended it as a creative choice.
ALSO READ | Salaar Movie Review: Prabhasâ€™ violence-riddled film is all noise, meaning very little
In an interview with News18, the Malayalam star, who is also a film director, said that if a filmmaker wants to shoot graphic violence for his story, he should have the liberty to do so. He pointed out that every film is certified by the Central Board of Film Certification and the body decides who can watch the film. â€œOur responsibility as a filmmaker is to make sure that we submit it to the Censor Board. How we make the film should be left to us,â€ he said.
He stated, â€œThe audience has already been told about a filmâ€™s certification because it has violence or nudity. Censorship should happen in the exhibition sector to keep a tab on who goes to the theatre and who gets to see it. As an artist, Iâ€™ve always believed that we should have the liberty of making what we want to. Who sees the material should be regulated as it is.â€ Defending Salaarâ€™s violent scenes, Prithviraj said that the film wonâ€™t be the same with violence. â€œThe violence in Salaar is very much a character in the plot and itâ€™s a screenplay instrument to further the drama. Without the violence, Salaar wonâ€™t be what it is.â€
Salaar Part 1: Ceasefire, directed by Prashanth Neel, is set in a fictional kingdom named Khansaar. Prithviraj has played the role of Vardha Mannar, one of the governors of the city, who wants to become its king. When a coup is staged to overthrow him, Vardha seeks help from his old friend Deva (Prabhas). The film, which is loosely based on Prashanth Neelâ€™s Ugramm, has collected more than Rs 200 crore at the domestic box office in a matter of four days. Other than Prabhas and Prithviraj, the film also has Shruti Haasan, Jagapati Babu, and Bobby Simha in important roles."
"Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Dunki is picking pace at the box office with each passing day, even in the face of strong competition from Prabhasâ€™ Salaar. On the fourth day, the Rajkumar Hirani-directed film witnessed a jump of around 25 percent, raking in Rs 31.50 crores and successfully securing its spot in the 100 crore club. As per industry tracker Sacnilk, the movie earned Rs 29.20 crore on its opening day, followed by Rs 20.12 crore on its first Friday and Rs 25.61 crore on its first Saturday.
Dunki day 4 box office collection in India and worldwide stands at Rs 108 crore and an estimated Rs 215 crore, respectively. Dunki reported an overall 49.67 percent Hindi occupancy on Sunday, with an uptick in the evening. With Monday being a holiday on account of Christmas, the film is expected to do well at the ticket wondows. The film also marks the first collaboration between Hirani and Shah Rukh. Sunday marked the biggest day for the Shah Rukh starrer, both India and internationally.

"AIt was the turn of Ghum Hai Kisikey Pyaar Meiin actress Aishwarya Sharma Bhatt to walk out of the Bigg Boss 17 house as another round of eviction took place. This elimination came after the current captain of the Bigg Boss house Isha Malviya named Aishwarya for breaking the rules of the house, leading to the ex-Khatron Ke Khiladi contestant exiting the Salman Khan-hosted reality show. After exiting Bigg Boss 17, Aishwarya sat down for a quick conversation with Indian Express where she commented on her eviction, her and husband Neil Bhattâ€™s rivalry with Vicky Jain and Ankita Lokhande, and the infamous slap controversy involving Vicky and Ankita.
On her eviction Aishwarya said, â€œI wanted to win the trophy, but I got eliminated for breaking rules, so I am very disappointed. It was a very unfair decision from Isha. She has always been very clear with her stand, so I was hopeful that she would not take my name. I have never broken a rule, may be I was a strong competitor, and she chose to evict me. She has just gotten very overconfident.â€

"When actor Aishwarya Sharma walked into the Bigg Boss 17 house with her husband Neil Bhatt, she certainly came across as a strong player. But soon after, it was pretty evident that both Aishwarya and Neil were struggling to make their place in the game. From getting enough wake up calls from Bigg Boss to fighting with one another, it was a bumpy ride for the couple. Now, leaving it all behind Aishwarya has been evicted from Bigg Boss 17.
This week, the nominated contestants included her, Neil Bhatt, Ankita Lokhande, and Anurag Dobhal. The current captain of the house, Isha Malviya, was asked to pick a player to eliminate. While she first chose Anurag, she later changed her mind and decided to eliminate Aishwarya. It will be interesting to see how Neil will proceed to handle the drama on the show without his wife being on his side.

"It has been a fantastic year for Shah Rukh Khan â€” he scripted the someback of dreams with Pathaan, cemented his golden run with Jawaan and is in the middle of the box office run of his third release of the year, Dunki.

Dunki box office collection day 4 stands at an estimated Rs 100 crore domestically, while it is eyeing Rs 200 crore club with its global gross. After three days of its release, the film has made Rs 157.22 crore globally and with its Sundayâ€™s box office collection, will inch closer to Rs 200 crore mark.

"â€œTum mujhe yun bhula na paoge, jab kabhi bhi sunoge geet mere, sang sang tum bhi gungunaogeâ€¦â€ (You wonâ€™t be able to forget me. Whenever you will listen to my songs, you will sing along).
Filmed on Shammi Kapoorâ€™s character Sujeet (Pagla Kahin Ka), the song had a young lover lamenting the pain of being separated from his lover (Asha Parekh). The song is a slow burn as singer Mohammed Rafi plumbs the depths of pain and pathos for much of its duration. While pictured on Kapoor and aimed at Parekh, the lyrics resonate with what Rafi brought to Hindi cinema as one of the most iconic playback singers.

"Filmmaker Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Animal recently made waves at the box office with a massive Rs 850 crore global haul. The runtime of Animal is approximately 3 hours and 21 minutes, which significantly reduces the number of shows that can be fit into a single day. The filmmaker, who also served as the filmâ€™s editor, has now revealed that he regrets editing an additional nine minutes under pressure. Vanga also opened up about how the last few days before release were â€˜horrible.â€™ Animal stars Ranbir Kapoor, Rashmika Mandanna, Bobby Deol and Anil Kapoor in pivotal roles.
In an interview with Komal Nahta, Vanga opened up about what he thought when he watched the film for the first time. He said, â€œWhen I saw the film for the first time, I spotted a lot of problems. Content wise, I felt there were problems with sound. What happened was, since we were releasing in five languages, I lost track of which language sound I was checking. Last 20 days were horrible. We slept in the mixing room for almost three to four days. That should not have happened, there should have been one more week. But I am correcting all those problems for the Netflix version and we are planning to get a Blu-ray also.â€

"Filmmaker Sandeep Reddy Vanga said that it was his â€œfaultâ€ that he first cast Parineeti Chopra opposite Ranbir Kapoor in Animal, but later let her go and cast actor Rashmika Mandanna as her replacement. In an interview, Vanga said that Parineeti felt bad about being replaced, but at the end of the day, she wasnâ€™t right for the role of Geetanjali, and the film always takes priority over everything else.
In an interview with Komal Nahta, when asked about Parineeti, the filmmaker said, â€œGalti mera he hai (It is my fault). I told her ho sake toh maaf karo mujhe (if possible, please forgive me).â€ In the film, Rashmika played Geetanjali, Ranbirâ€™s wife.

"Director Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s latest film, Animal, faced criticism for its violence and unapologetic toxic masculinity, despite emerging as one of the biggest blockbusters of Indian cinema history. The Ranbir Kapoor-starrer received mixed to negative reviews, and certain scenes received a lot of criticism from both critics and the audience. The filmmaker has now revealed that he has â€˜dilutedâ€™ the violence in the film to make it more palatable. 
In an interview with Komal Nahta, Vanga said, â€œTo be frank, I have diluted a few scenes, because I felt it would be too much for the Indian audience. But that happens subconsciously because I am also an audience of Indian cinema. I myself go to the theatres and watch movies, so I always match my IQ with the audience, I keep it directly proportional.â€

When prompted to respond to a tweet suggesting that he seek psychiatric help, Sandeep replied, â€œHe (the person who tweeted)  needs to go to the psychiatrist. Because he needs to understand that this is not what I am doing in real life, this is cinema, this is art, this is expression. I will make a few scenes uncomfortable, thatâ€™s the quality of the film, thatâ€™s the quality of art. It will upset you, it will provoke you, it will irritate you. If I do it in real life, if I take a rifle and barge into a reviewers office, that time you can tell me to consult a psychiatrist.â€

Vanga recently commented on critics, drawing parallels with what happened after the release of his previous film, Kabir Singh. According to him, many critics lack knowledge and education about film craft, often overlooking aspects like editing and sound design in their reviews. In an interview with Connect FM Canada, he said, â€œIn a way, I understood their mental status and their IQ. If morality comes into the picture, then you canâ€™t make this film. If everybody is going to focus just on the morality, we should stop making films. Letâ€™s just make cartoons.â€

"Actor Anil Kapoor has completed 40 years in the Hindi film industry but his initial years werenâ€™t as smooth despite being the son of well-known producer Surinder Kapoor.

In an interview with Midday, Anil remembered his father, who passed away in 2011. Anil said, â€œHe was very honest, decent, and kind of an introvert. He was a good man and so he was not one of the pushy, filmy or aggressive ones. He was a gentleman.â€

"Dibakar Banerjeeâ€™s Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye, starring Abhay Deol in the lead role, was released just two days after the 26/11 attacks on 28 November 2008, and given the state of the country, the film did not draw much attention at the time. Banerjee thinks that no matter how much praise the film receives now, people were â€œdisappointedâ€ when it came out in the theatres back in the day. He also explained how the film was â€œanti-Khosla Ka Ghoslaâ€, his other superhit film, which has gained a cult status over the years.
While speaking to Samdish Bhatia for his show, Unfiltered by Samdish, Banerjee said, â€œNowadays people take names of Khosla (Ka Ghosla) and Oye Lucky (Lucky Oye) in one breath. But when Oye Lucky came out, many were disappointed because of its straight anti-middle class stance.â€

"It can now be reasonably concluded that Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s, Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Dunki has lost in its ultimate box office face-off against Prashanth Neelâ€™s Salaar: Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire. Despite 2023 being the most successful year of Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s career, highlighted by the remarkable performance of two of his films, Siddharth Anandâ€™s Pathaan and Atlee Kumarâ€™s Jawan, each grossing over Rs 1,000 crore, he couldnâ€™t replicate the same level of success for Dunki.
After earning Rs 29.2 crore in the domestic market on its debut day and Rs 20.50 crore on Friday, Dunki is likely to deliver a similar performance on Saturday, with earnings expected to be in line with those of December 22.

"Dibakar Banerjeeâ€™s directorial Khosla Ka Ghosla was released in 2006, three years after being shot. The film, starring Anupam Kher, Boman Irani, Ranvir Shorey, Vinay Pathak, Parvin Dabas, Tara Sharma and others, attained a cult status over the years and is counted among one of the best satirical comedies. But Banerjee can no longer â€œrelateâ€ to the film and the only emotion that he feels about it is â€œnostalgiaâ€. In his opinion, the film is â€œvery patriarchalâ€.
Banerjee recently appeared on the latest episode of Unfiltered by Samdish where he said that he wonâ€™t be able to make a Khosla Ka Ghosla today. Expressing his opinion about the film, Banerjee said, â€œKhosla Ka Ghosla is a very patriarchal film. I canâ€™t make a film as patriarchal as that anymore. It will feel like a lie.â€ The filmmaker feels that he was able to make it back in the day because, â€œAt the age of 35-36, you are in guilt, you donâ€™t even know what you are saying, you are just making a patriarchal film.â€

"Filmmaker Dibakar Banerjee has opened up about how Indian actors are â€˜still framed actorsâ€™ and how he finds â€˜boredomâ€™ in that. When he was asked if he would be open to collaborate with Shah Rukh Khan, the director said that it would be unlikely as the star would not be interested in doing a three-month workshop with him. He also discussed the term â€˜100 crore clubâ€™ and itâ€™s evolution.
On the podcast Unfiltered with Samdish, Dibakar talked about the â€˜style of the star systemâ€™ and said, â€œHypothetically I will tell Shah Rukh that, â€˜Shah Rukh, we have to do a workshop of 3 months. He will say â€˜I will do it, Iâ€™ll just come.â€™ And he will go (Shah Rukh), and will not come back. What does star system mean is that I am a star, and I have a scene with you. I am doing it, I am doing the scene with you. But I know that â€˜150 croresâ€™ is sitting hereâ€™. The star has this awareness, totally, in every scene. So, I mean you can see all the stars do this. Now I feel a little boredom in that.â€

"In a significant setback for Tamil actor Mansoor Ali Khan, the Madras High Court on Friday refused to grant him permission to file a defamation suit against actors Trisha Krishnan, Chiranjeevi and Khushbu Sundar, as reported by Bar and Bench. Khan has been facing the heat ever since he made offensive and misogynistic comments about his Leo co-star Trisha.

"Filmmaker Dibakar Banerjee recently opened up about the rather strange release of Arjun Kapoor and Parineeti Chopraâ€˜s Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar in 2021. The film released in a few theatres just before the second wave of the pandemic and later found its audience when it was dropped on Prime Video. Dibakar said that no one, including him and Arjun, was aware of the filmâ€™s streaming and only found out when they saw it on their platform.
In an interview with YouTuber Samdish Bhatia, the director said that Arjun Kapoor called to inform him that the film had released. He also shared that he had no idea because there was no marketing for the film. He said, â€œThe way Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar was released, you know how it was released? Arjun called me and said, â€˜Sir, it has released (The film has been released!â€™ I was like, what are you saying and he said that he saw it was released on Amazon. So I asked him about marketing and he said he didnâ€™t know about  marketing but the film had released.â€

"Filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani recently opened up about collaborating with Shah Rukh Khan on Dunki and mentioned that he has wanted to work with the actor ever since he first saw him in the television show Circus. Hirani has been making movies for over twenty years now and has made some of the most successful films of all time and shared that working with SRK has been a long harboured dream.
â€œI recall watching this series called Circus and I vividly remember the scene including the camera angle where one actor was performing and delivering a monologue. I didnâ€™t know who he was but I loved his performance. I told myself once I passed out from school, I would approach him and make a film,â€ Hirani told News 18 in an interview. â€œIt took me two years to graduate from the film institute and by that time, Shah Rukh Khan had become a huge star (laughs). So, I had to wait for 20 years to collaborate with him on a film,â€ he added.

The film, centered on a troubled father-son relationship, has sparked discussions with mixed to negative reviews, citing concerns about its portrayal of misogyny. Charu Shankar, who played Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s mother in the movie, revealed that she and Ranbir are just a year apart and also opened up about Sandeep expressing surprise upon their first meeting.
In an interview with Bollywood Hungama, Charu said, â€œWe (Her and Ranbir) are only one year apart; that is true. As an actor, why would I refuse? This was an opportunity which was a very exciting opportunity. I knew the cast; I knew what the film was, when Sandeep narrated the story. I thought it was very interesting, very different. And he told me from the word go, he said, â€˜I want you to play a very crucial part in my film. I want you to establish very quickly in the film what the central conflict of the film is.'â€

"Rajkumar Hirani is one of those rare Indian filmmakers who has never had a flop in his career. Box office hits, which donâ€™t necessarily speak about a filmâ€™s quality or longevity, however, have nothing to do with a filmâ€™s success, and here, Rajkumar Hirani does not have a 100 percent hit rate. Hirani started making movies in 2003 and his first film Munna Bhai MBBS was a crowd-pleaser. He subsequently turned it into a franchise with Lage Raho Munna Bhai and then moved on to making films like 3 Idiots, PK, and Sanju. Over the two decades that Hirani has been making movies, he has established a certain style for himself that hasnâ€™t evolved much. People crack jokes in emotional situations and the extras in the scene end up in tears with smiles on their faces, the characters give out life lessons but in a Sadhguru-like way where they can sound new age-y and turn it into a catchphrase for the filmâ€™s marketing, and the jokes here are as massy as the ones that appear in Kapil Sharmaâ€™s shows.
Letâ€™s talk about his last release Sanju, a biopic on actor Sanjay Duttâ€™s life, where Hirani whitewashed Sanjayâ€™s image to the point where it was anyone elseâ€™s fault but Sanjayâ€™s for the way his life turned out. Sanju was like a PR exercise to clean up Sanjay Duttâ€™s image in front of the masses who, by the way, are still not inclined to buy tickets for a film that is solely led by him. The entire film had a â€˜becharaâ€™ vibe going for him that left you wondering if this was indeed the life story of a man born with a silver spoon who chose to throw his life away many times, but was awarded multiple chances every time he reached the cusp. The idea that the media was to be blamed for Sanjayâ€™s problems was simply bizarre but this became the grand conclusion of Hiraniâ€™s film. Sure, Ranbir got a chance to flex his acting muscles but making a hagiography for a man who is still working in the public eye was an odd choice by Hirani, that made for an odd film that isnâ€™t the kind that will end up in anyoneâ€™s list of favourites.

"Filmmaker Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s film Dunki, featuring Shah Rukh Khan in the lead role, hit theaters on Thursday. After the success of SRKâ€™s Jawan and Pathaan earlier this year, thereâ€™s curiosity about whether Dunki, which is not billed as a mass entertainer, can capture the audienceâ€™s attention similar to his previous two films.
Opening up about the same, Shah Rukh said, â€œI feel we kind of analyse films a lot. We keep talking too much about mass oriented and content oriented. I think films are entertainment oriented. In any which way they make us feel good, entertain us, whatever their topic is. I donâ€™t think Jawan or Pathaan were mass cinema, they were just entertaining films. I hope they were entertaining.â€

"Shah Rukh Khan starrer Dunki was released in theatres on Thursday to a mixed response. Shah Rukh, who plays the role of Hardy in the film, has opened up about how he has been â€˜age-honestâ€™ for the first time in the Rajkumar Hirani directorial. SRK also said that he is comfortable playing his own age and also made a comparison to his role in Jawan.
The actor said, â€œI am 58 now and I feel I should do age-centric roles now. Jawan was more like a commercial, â€˜in-your-faceâ€™ kind of character. I wonâ€™t call it a caricature, but it was an over the top old person. In this (Dunki), he is very real. And to be a certain age and span that many years is very interesting. I would say I have been â€˜age honestâ€™ for the first time in Dunki. Itâ€™s more close to my age. And I think I have tried to play it as real as possible. Itâ€™s not a conscious effort, but I am comfortable playing my age and others. Since I look young, people donâ€™t want to give me older roles.â€

"It is just the second day of Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Dunki in cinema halls, and the film is already struggling to ensure a steady flow of cinegoers. After earning Rs 29 crore on its opening day (Thursday) in India, the film saw a huge dip on its second day.
As per early estimates, posted at 8 pm, by trade tracker Sacnilk, the Rajkumar Hirani film is expected to earn around Rs 14.63 crore nett on Friday, bringing the filmâ€™s total collection in India to Rs 43.63 crore. The film registered a lower occupancy, 25.20%, in the Hindi-speaking belt of the country. This dip in the filmâ€™s collection can be attributed to the thunderous opening of Prashanth Neelâ€™s action-thriller Salaar. Led by Prabhas, the film opened with a gross collection of around Rs 135 crore in India. Globally, the film is expected to earn over Rs 175 crore on its opening day.

The poster is a shot of an empty park bench with the vast blue sea in the background. Instead of one, we have two crescent moons doubling up as alphabets â€˜DDâ€™ (Dhanushâ€™s Directorial). The whole scene creates the mood of a pleasant and romantic evening, hinting that the film could be a romantic drama."

While Dunki debuted to around Rs 30 crore India nett on Thursday, Salaar has already earned nearly Rs 50 crore in advance sales for Day One and is likely to, according to industry tracker Sacnilk, achieve an opening day collection of Rs 95 crore domestically, surpassing even Atlee Kumarâ€™s Shah Rukh Khan blockbuster Jawanâ€™s first-day collection of Rs 75 crore â€“ the highest this year until now.

"There seems to be some serious fault in Munawar Faruquiâ€™s stars in the Bigg Boss 17 house. First, his rumored girlfriend Ayesha Khan entered the show as a wildcard contestant and now it seems his friendship with Mannara Chopra has also hit a rough patch. With all the captaincy chaos going on in the house, there is some friction viewers will get to see between Munawar and Mannara. The argument will get so heated that she will ask the Lock Upp Season 1 winner to stay away from her.
As per the latest promo from Colors TV, Mannara appears to be upset with Munawar over a statement he made during the captaincy task. Following this, she is seen expressing her displeasure, but when Munawar disagrees with her, she calls him a hypocrite."

Hopkins is literally reduced to an exposition device, in a movie where one character greets another not with a customary â€˜helloâ€™, but with, â€œYouâ€™re the legendary assassin known only by the name of Nemesis. Assassinated 16 high ranking imperial officers and their security detail, all in a hunt to avenge your slaughtered children.â€ What?

"Fighter, starring Deepika Padukone and Hrithik Roshan, dropped its second song Ishq Jaisa Kuch on Friday. The song is set on a beachside and can best be described as a love song for the lead couple. Composed by Vishal & Sheykhar with vocals by Vishal & Sheykhar, Shilpa Rao and Mellow D, the song has been penned by Kumaar.
The song might grow on the audience but the initial impact left by Deepika and Hrithik is simply unmissable. It also makes you wonder why no one ever cast Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone in the same film even though they have been contemporaries for over a decade and a half.

Celebrities like Samantha Ruth Prabhu, Tovino Thomas and Shane Nigam wished the couple in the comments section of the actorâ€™s post.
Dulquer Salmaan and Amal Sufi got married back in 2011, even before he made his debut as an actor in Second Show (2012). Dulquer keeps sharing posts about Amal on Instagram. He penned a similar note on her birthday in September. â€œAmmmmm !!â€ â€œMammaaaaa !!!â€ The two most common sounds in our house. No matter how exhausted you are or how long your day has been you always find the energy for us,â€ he wrote. Dulquer and Amal have a six-year-old daughter, who is kept out of the limelight. 
On the work front, Dulquer had a disappointing year as his big-budget film King of Kotha failed to make the intended impact despite a lot of promotion. Coming to his upcoming projects, Dulquer is part of Kamal Haasan-Mani Ratnamâ€™s upcoming film Thug Life. "
"Actor Vadivelu has lashed out at people who criticized director Mari Selvaraj for helping flood-affected people of Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi. Vadivelu said that Selvaraj belongs to the place, and he would be in a better position to help them and thereâ€™s nothing wrong with it.
Speaking at an event in Chennai, Vadivelu was asked about the backlash faced by Selvaraj for his voluntary relief work in Tirunelveli. The actor, who has worked with the director in Maamannan, said, â€œPeople are asking why Mari Selvaraj was present during relief work. It is his hometown. He knows the town well and knows where the hill and where the pit is. If there is a flood in my town, who else will go instead of me? Is Mari Selvaraj from the USA?â€"
"Actors Bipasha Basu and Karan Singh Grover took their 13-month-old daughter, Devi, to her first-ever birthday party.

Bipasha shared a glimpse of her daughterâ€™s first party as an â€˜attendeeâ€™ on social media.
Bipasha posted pictures of herself and husband Karan with Devi where she looked cute as a button in her white frock, which had a big bow at the back.

"Director Christo Tomy takes a sensationalist approach to what could have been a been a complex story of infighting among family members, lasting resentments, and cruel betrayals, in Curry & Cyanide â€“ The Jolly Joseph Story, the rare Netflix true crime film that could have benefited from the streamerâ€™s typical three-episode structure. As it stands, Curry & Cyanide comes across as a sleazy slasher movie masquerading as an exhaustively researched account of horrific crimes.
Between 2002 and 2014, six people died under similarly mysterious circumstances in Keralaâ€™s Koodathayi. Four of them were relatives; the other two were closely connected to the same family. In 2019, a middle-aged woman named Jolly Joseph was arrested on suspicion of killing them with cyanide. Her husband, Roy, fell unconscious in the bathroom, while the infant daughter of a man she had her eye on was said to have choked on food some years later. Some years after that, that manâ€™s wife died at a dentistâ€™s office, while Jollyâ€™s uncle and in-laws were all declared dead after having collapsed without warning. She was present on each occasion."
"Salaar Movie Review: Itâ€™s tempting to dub â€˜Salaar Part Oneâ€™ â€˜KGFâ€™ Redux, except it is bigger and bloodier. It is bathed in the same colour palette â€” shades of black limned with red. It has the same appetite for violence, with a higher body count. And instead of one hero, it has two, Prabhas and Prithviraj, playing childhood best friends whose primary job as able-bodied adults is to cleave through flesh, and lop off heads: let it not be said that Prashanth Neel doesnâ€™t have a taste for blood. No, let it not.
Let it also not be said that Neel doesnâ€™t have the gift for world-building. The fictional â€˜Khansaarâ€™, an outpost somewhere in India which doesnâ€™t follow any rules except its own, is impressive. It is ruled by a king (Jagapathi Babu) who has clawed his way to the throne after having decimated challenges from the two rival tribes that have lived there for â€˜a thousand yearsâ€™: the figure is used in the film enough times to give it a proper little epical ring."
"Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga claimed that it wasnâ€™t a conscious decision to show inter-caste relationships in each of his three movies â€“ the Telugu-language hit Arjun Reddy, its Hindi remake Kabir Singh, and the recent blockbuster Animal. In an interview, the provocative filmmaker also spoke about the rebellious kiss that Ranbir Kapoor and Rashmika Mandannaâ€™s characters share as an act of defiance against their families in Animal.
Speaking to Galatta Plus, Vanga was asked about his fascination with inter-caste relationships, and he said that it wasnâ€™t deliberate. â€œI see a lot of Telugu and Tamil families settled in Delhi. Maybe I like seeing inter-region and inter-caste marriageâ€¦â€ Asked about the kiss, and the way it has been staged in the film with a rock song in the background, Vanga said, â€œThereâ€™s a recklessness in the rock. You feel like theyâ€™re voicing out their rage. Thereâ€™s a bit of negligence also in that,â€ he said.

"Shah Rukh Khan took a five year-hiatus from movies after 2018 but 2023 will always be remembered by SRK fans as a year when King Khan made a comeback and how! Through these years, Shah Rukh Khan worked on three films â€“ Pathaan, Jawan and Dunki â€“ which have all released this year and SRK is yet to announce his next film. Now, the star has dropped a hint about his next film and shared that he will start shooting for it by March-April.
In a chat with Raya Abirached, Shah Rukh shared that he will be taking up a role that is â€œmore age realâ€ to him but he will still be the star of the film. When asked about his next film, he said, â€œI think I will start one in March-April now. Like I have been attempting now to do a film which is more age real to me and play it still as the protagonist and the star of the film.â€

"Actor Shah Rukh Khan made his first public appearance following the release of his new film, Dunki, at producer and real estate developer Anand Panditâ€™s 60th birthday party on Thursday evening. The bash was attended by high-profile film industry personalities such as Salman Khan, Amitabh Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan as well. At the party, Shah Rukh gave a speech in honour of Pandit, and called the producer his â€˜spiritual guruâ€™.
In a video from the party, Shah Rukh can be seen on the stage, standing next to Pandit and singer Sonu Nigam. In his speech, he said that he wakes up at midnight like an â€˜ullu (owl)â€™ and goes on drives around Juhu with Pandit. He joked that Pandit owns so much real estate in the neighbourhood that itâ€™s easier for him to point out the buildings he doesnâ€™t own as opposed to the ones that he does.

"Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga, who recently delivered the third successive box office hit of his career with Animal, spoke about a particularly controversial scene from the movie, which has contributed to the perception of it being misogynistic. Despite its global gross exceeding Rs 850 crore, Animal has been criticised for its glorification of toxic masculinity and for Vangaâ€™s apparent disregard for his filmsâ€™ morality.
In an interview with Galatta Plus, he was asked about the scene in which the lead character Ranvijay, played by Ranbir Kapoor, instructs his wife Geetanjali, played by Rashmika Mandanna, to not remarry in the event of his death. He said, â€œIn relationships, most of the time, youâ€™re done. Multiple partners could be a habit. Once youâ€™re with one person, the share of love with that one person, you are done for life. That could be the exchange between Geetanjali and Ranvijay. And knowing the psyche of Geetanjali, there are so many things in a relationship that are unsaid, so he must have felt that she canâ€™t make it with anybody else, so sheâ€™d better remain single.â€

"Siddhant Chaturvedi, who will soon be seen in Kho Gaye Hum Kahan, with Ananya Panday and Adarsh Gourav recently shared an anecdote where he ran into Shah Rukh Khan at a club. Siddhant was there with his group of friends and King Khan being as gracious as he always is, met the actor warmly. After they exchanged pleasantries, Shah Rukh asked Siddhant if he wanted to join an after-party at his home Mannat. When the Gully Boy actor said that he was with his friends, Shah Rukh invited the whole bunch.
Siddhant shared with ETimes that he told Shah Rukh, â€œI have my laundas (boys) with me.â€ And to this, Shah Rukh said, â€œVoh launde hain toh hum bhi jawan hain.â€ Soon after, they all headed to Shah Rukhâ€™s house Mannat and partied till 5 in the morning.

"Director Jude Anthany Joseph took to social media to express his disappointment after his film, the Malayalam-language blockbuster 2018, failed to make it to the Oscars shortlist in the Best International Feature category. In an Instagram message, Joseph shared a screenshot of the 15 shortlisted films, and apologised to his well-wishers and fans of the movie.
Released earlier this year, 2018 is a disaster drama focusing on the Kerala floods of the same year. The film starred a host of well-known figures from the Malayalam-language film industry, such as Tovino Thomas, Kunchako Boban, Lal, and others, and grossed more than Rs 200 crore worldwide, emerging as the biggest Malayalam-language hit of all time. Some would wonder why 2018, a mainstream blockbuster, was chosen to compete in the highly coveted category in the first place. Most films that have proceeded to the next stage played at prestigious European festivals."
"Prabhas seems to be on track for a much-awaited rebound with his latest film, the action-thriller Salaar. Directed by Prashanth Neel, the pan-India film is facing off at the box office against Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Dunki, which it is handily outpacing. While Dunki debuted to around Rs 30 crore on opening day, Salaar has already earned over Rs 135 crore in advance sales for day one, which happens to be today.
According to Homable Films, the production company backing Salaar, the film sold 30.5 lakh tickets in advance with the collection of Rs 95 crore coming from the pre-booking of tickets. By 7 pm on Friday, the film managed to gross Rs 135 crore in India and earned Rs 175 crore gross globally.

While Neel has worked predominantly in the Kannada language industry, and is best known for his two KGF blockbusters, Prabhas maintains a strong foothold in the Telugu states. Unlike the performance of the recent hit Animal, which seemed to generate interest both in the Hindi belt thanks to star Ranbir Kapoor and in the Telugu regions thanks to director Sandeep Reddy Vanga, Salaar is clearly attracting audiences on the strength of Prabhasâ€™ stardom.
Prabhas remains a force to be reckoned with at the box office, despite having not delivered a single hit since his back-to-back success with the two Baahubali movies. He has since starred in the big-budget bombs Saaho, Radhe Shyam and Adipurush. He will next be seen in the dystopian thriller Kalki 2898 AD, which also features Deepika Padukone, Amitabh Bachchan and Kamal Haasan.
Meanwhile, Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Dunki is going to have to battle somewhat lukewarm reviews and underwhelming box office returns if it wants to make an impact in the long run. The movie registered Shah Rukhâ€™s lowest opening of the year, behind Jawan and Pathaan, and fell short of even director Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s Sanju."
"Actors Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, and many others attended the 60th birthday party of film producer Anand Pandit, where he also launched his biography. As Amitabh and Abhishek took to the stage with singer Sonu Nigam, actor Salman Khan joined them. It was a rare sight for the fans, as the Bachchans and Salman arenâ€™t often seen together socially.
Salman Khan greeted Amitabh Bachchan with a hug, and later hugged Abhishek as well. But the internet also seemed to notice that he did not greet Sonu Nigam.

"Shah Rukh Khan has had the best year of his career so far, with his films Jawan and Pathaan both delivering over Rs 1,000 crore worldwide, but his latest, Dunki, hasnâ€™t been able to create the same sort of buzz upon its release. Dunki was released in theatres on Thursday, and on its opening day, the film made Rs 30 crore nett domestic, as per industry tracker Sacnilk. This makes it the yearâ€™s seventh-biggest opener after Jawan, Animal, Pathaan, Tiger 3, Gadar 2 and Adipurush. While Jawan opened with Rs 75 crore, even the historic flop Adipurush managed to make Rs 36 crore on its opening day.
The opening day figures make it the least successful Shah Rukh film of the year, but the opening is still bigger than those delivered by Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan (Rs 15.81 crore), Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar (Rs 15.73 crore), Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani (Rs 11.1 crore) and Dream Girl 2 (Rs 10.69 crore).

"The Barbie power ballad â€œIâ€™m Just Kenâ€ and AP and Frontlineâ€™s documentary 20 Days in Mariupol just got one step closer to an Oscar nomination. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced Thursday shortlists in 10 categories, including best original song, documentary feature, international feature, original score, and crafts like hair and makeup, visual effects and sound.
Mstyslav Chernovâ€™s 20 Days in Mariupol was shortlisted in both the documentary and international feature categories, representing Ukraine in the latter.
As expected, Greta Gerwigâ€™s Barbie, Christopher Nolanâ€™s Oppenheimer and Martin Scorseseâ€™s Killers of the Flower Moon were prominently represented among the finalists in many categories, including score and sound, as was Jonathan Glazerâ€™s The Zone of Interest. Yorgos Lanthimosâ€™ Poor Things also advanced in makeup, visual effects and score and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse in visual effects, song and score.
ADVERTISEMENT
Among the 15 international features advancing are The Zone of Interest (United Kingdom), Tráº§n Anh HÃ¹ngâ€™s The Taste of Things (France), Lila AvilÃ©sâ€™ TÃ³tem (Mexico) and Aki KaurismÃ¤kiâ€™s Fallen Leaves (Finland). Justine Trietâ€™s acclaimed Anatomy of a Fall was not selected to represent France and thus was not eligible in the category. Indiaâ€™s disaster film 2018 was, but didnâ€™t make it to the shortlist.
Original song contenders competing against â€œIâ€™m Just Kenâ€ include two other songs from Barbie: Dua Lipaâ€™s â€œDance the Nightâ€ and Billie Eilishâ€™s â€œWhat Was I Made For?â€ Only two songs from a single movie can advance to the nomination stage, however. Both â€œFlora and Sonâ€ and â€œThe Color Purpleâ€ had two songs advance.
Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie in a still from Barbie.
Other contenders include Sharon Van Etten for â€œQuiet Eyesâ€ from Past Lives, Olivia Rodrigo for Canâ€™t Catch Me Now, from The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, Jon Batiste for â€œIt Never Went Awayâ€ from American Symphony, Lenny Kravitz for his Rustin song â€œRoad to Freedomâ€ and Jarvis Cockerâ€™s â€œDear Alien (Who Art In Heaven)â€ from Asteroid City.
Diane Warren will also get another shot at a nomination for â€œThe Fire Insideâ€ from Flaminâ€™ Hot. But several expected finalists were left off, including Justin Timberlake for Trolls Band Together and Jack Black for his Super Mario Bros. Movie ballad â€œPeaches.â€ Wonka was also missing from the list.

The 15 original score finalists included a number of familiar players, including John Williams (Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny), Ludwig GÃ¶ransson (Oppenheimer), Mica Levi (The Zone of Interest) and the late Robbie Robertson for Killers of the Flower Moon. Joe Hisaishi could also be headed for his first Oscar nomination for The Boy and the Heron.
Composer Kris Bowers advanced for The Color Purple, but not for Origin, which also missed out in the song category. Past Lives, by Christopher Bear and Daniel Rossen, was another surprise exclusion from the score finalists.
Documentary nominees in addition to 20 Days in Mariupol include American Symphony, about Batiste, Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie, Going to Mars: The Nikki Giovanni Project, The Eternal Memory, A Still Small Voice and Four Daughters. Some were surprised at the omission of Kokomo City, about the lives of Black trans sex workers, and Little Richard: I Am Everything.
Barbie missed the cut for makeup and hairstyling, which included nominations for Beau is Afraid, Poor Things, Maestro, Oppenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon and Napoleon.

Though Oppenheimer fared well in most categories, it was not among the finalists in the visual effects category. The filmâ€™s surprising omission from the list of the original 20 finalists was previously reported. The visual effects contenders are often comprised of superhero and franchise films that arenâ€™t otherwise considered big awards players â€” this year that includes Zack Snyderâ€™s poorly reviewed Rebel Moon-Part One: A Child of Fire, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.
Live action, animated and documentary shorts finalists were also announced. The live action category is a little starrier than usual, with both Pedro AlmodÃ³varâ€™s Ethan Hawke and Pedro Pascal western Strange Way of Life and Wes Andersonâ€™s The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, with Benedict Cumberbatch and Ben Kingsley, among the contenders.
For the most part, shortlists are determined by members in their respective categories, though the specifics vary from branch to branch: Some have committees, some have minimum viewing requirements.
Final nominations in all categories will be announced on Jan. 23. The 96th Oscars, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, will be held on March 10, broadcasting live on ABC from the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. The show will begin one hour earlier than usual, at 7 p.m. ET.

"If director Emerald Fennellâ€™s breakout first feature was the #MeToo eraâ€™s most furious creative marker, her hotly-anticipated follow-up, this weekâ€™s Saltburn, is a gigantic middle finger to everybody who hailed her as a Promising Young Woman in 2020. Her filmmaking isnâ€™t for the faint-hearted, and if Sandeep Reddy Vanga wasnâ€™t so busy seething his own success, heâ€™d do well to study Saltburn, easily the most provocative movie of the year.
A deliciously depraved dark comedy about class warfare, it makes the decidedly subversive choice to portray the grotesquely rich as the least insane. In a society broken beyond repair, the movie says with a smirk, only the Parasites will survive. But how palatable can empty provocation be, at the end of the day? In a movie that positively challenges you to check out, especially in that deranged final act, you canâ€™t help but wonder what the point of it all is â€” generating oohs and aahs, or genuine introspection?
Also read â€“ The Archies: Zoya Akhtarâ€™s politically-charged film will be triggering for the Animal army
ADVERTISEMENT
Barry Keoghan stars as yet another of one those sociopaths that he has become so good at playing in his short career. In Saltburn, heâ€™s Oliver Quick, a middle-class misfit who struggles to find his bearings as a first-year scholarship student in Oxford. Almost immediately, he is awestruck by the aristocratic Felix Catton, played with feline grace by the newly minted heartthrob, Jacob Elordi. Felix is naturally charismatic, the centre of attraction at every party fortunate to have him as a guest â€” heâ€™s everything that the moth-like Oliver isnâ€™t. But after a couple of chance encounters, he finds himself developing a curiosity for Oliver, and before long, they become inseparable.
When Oliver bares his heart to him one day about his mentally ill parents, whoâ€™ve struggled his entire life with drug addiction, Felix feels an instant pang of pity and invites him to spend the summer at his familyâ€™s sprawling countryside estate, Saltburn. Oliver is taken by the pomp and splendour of it all, and Felixâ€™s family seems just as interested in him as he is in them.
Rosamund Pike and Richard E Grant play Felixâ€™s parents, delivering performances that deliberately feel like they donâ€™t belong together in the same movie. Pikeâ€™s Elspeth could easily be an alternate reality version of Amy from Gone Girl, if sheâ€™d never actually returned to the bamboozled Ben Affleck and had started a new life under an assumed identity. In her first interaction with Oliver, she declares that she has â€œa complete and utter horror of ugliness,â€ and doesnâ€™t bat an eyelid before describing her squatter friend Pamela â€” Carey Mulligan in a colourful cameo â€” as â€œthe wettest of wet blankets.â€ To Elspeth, people like Oliver and Pamela are mere playthings, distractions that she will cycle through like theyâ€™re seasonal fashion lines.
But forget eating the rich, Saltburn doesnâ€™t even pause to laugh at them. Of course, Oliverâ€™s early days at the palatial property offer plenty of opportunity for fish-out-of-water humour. But itâ€™s made clear fairly early on that he isnâ€™t exactly going to function as our surrogate in this strange world. If anything, itâ€™s the Catton family that comes across as more relatable, despite their frequently objectionable behaviour. So what if they host lavish parties that could give Jay Gatsby an inferiority complex; so what if theyâ€™re openly disdainful of others? Oliver â€” thanks mainly to genius casting or simply because of the way heâ€™s written â€” is always enigmatic and never endearing. This isnâ€™t necessary, of course, but even Joaquin Phoenixâ€™s Joker evoked a certain level of empathy.
ADVERTISEMENT
And this might understandably put you in an odd mood. The movie preys on the audienceâ€™s inherent decency, as it begs them to spare a thought for poor village bumpkin, only to yank the carpet out from under your feet deep in the second act. Oliver is the decoy protagonist, in many ways. The real hero of the story â€” the tragic hero â€” is Felix. And what a year Elordi is having, having balanced the harmless naÃ¯vetÃ© of his character here to the calculative villainy of his Elvis Presley, in the recent biopic Priscilla. Thereâ€™s a reason why heâ€™s being earmarked as Hollywoodâ€™s Next Big Thing.
Read more â€“ Fair Play movie review: New Netflix thriller is an unpleasant experience made palatable by phenomenal Phoebe Dynevor and Alden Ehrenreich performances
Fennell couldâ€™ve easily made Felix a more reprehensible fellow, but Elordi plays him as a bit of a himbo. Oliverâ€™s ulterior motives, on the other hand, are underlined as more sinister. There are moments in the filmâ€™s frankly unhinged final third that could compel some viewers to stage a walk-out â€” one scene in particular might be the most provocative thing put in a mainstream movie this year. As with her first film, Fennellâ€™s politics warrant a rigorous examination â€” she comes dangerously close to demonising the downtrodden and feeling pity for the privileged â€” but her formal evolution has been satisfying to witness.

"Deathâ€™s Game stars Park So-dam and Seo In-guk havenâ€™t been to India but are aware of the popularity K-dramas enjoy in the country, which is one of the destinations they would love to visit in future.
So-dam, best known to viewers for her role in Bong Joon-hoâ€™s Oscar-winning film Parasite and Korean dramas such as Cinderella with Four Knights and Record of Youth, said she learned a lot about India through her college friend and Squid Game star Anupam Tripathi.
â€œI havenâ€™t had the chance to visit India. However, I went to school with Anupam, you may know of him, heâ€™s an actor in Korea who came from India. We took classes together and in our downtime, weâ€™d take walks around a lake together and I heard so much about India from him,â€ So-dam told PTI in a virtual international roundtable.

Anupam, who broke out with his role of Ali Abdul, a Pakistani migrant worker in Squid Game, and So-dam studied at the Korean National University of Arts.

â€œRecently, I watched the variety show â€˜Adventure by Accidentâ€™ where they visit India and I was amazed at the variety of different sceneries and backdrops India had, depending on where you go. So Iâ€™d really love to visit one day,â€ she added.
The 32-year-old actor stars as Death in Amazon Prime Videoâ€™s fantasy drama Deathâ€™s Game, which revolves around In-gukâ€™s Choi Yi-jae. Yi-jae tries to end his life and angers Death who makes him experience the pain of death 12 more times through different incarnations. It is based on a popular webtoon.
In-guk, also a singer, is familiar to Korean drama enthusiasts for his roles in Reply 1997, Shopping King Louie, The Smile Has Left Your Eyes, Doom At Your Service and CafÃ© Minamdang.

The actor, 36, said he feels happy for the love and support he receives from his global fans. â€œUnfortunately, I havenâ€™t had the chance to visit India, so I would love to go when the opportunity comes and Iâ€™d love to meet the fans there,â€ he said.
Asked about the global stardom that Korean actors enjoy today given the popularity of K-dramas internationally, In-guk said he takes it as a responsibility.
â€œI feel very happy and grateful that the music I put out and the stories I tell through acting are loved both in Korea and in other parts of the world. And it gives me a greater sense of responsibility.
â€œI want to meet my fansâ€™ expectations with my art and make sure that my global fans are happy with what I put out there. It gives me a sense of determination, motivation and responsibility,â€ the actor told PTI.
ADVERTISEMENT
So-dam is happy that Deathâ€™s Game is available globally.
â€œIt makes me happy because we tell a story with many universal themes and messages that Iâ€™m sure will resonate with a lot of different people around the world. We also have a universally resonant message about life, how you should look back on it and think about how precious we all are and our day-to-day mundane lives are. I hope that the global audiences will watch the show and relate to the themes being delivered,â€ she added.
In-guk, who has already featured in the fantasy show Doom At Your Service, said he accepted the drama because he was already a fan of the original webtoon.
â€œThe drama carries a very important message, and itâ€™s one that makes me look back at my own life too. Thatâ€™s what I was drawn to the most,â€ he added.

So-dam makes a comeback to the screen after undergoing surgery for papillary thyroid cancer in December 2021.
The actor said the script of Deathâ€™s Game came to her during a time when she was â€œthinking a lot about the concepts of life and deathâ€.
â€œWhen I was reading the script, I deeply related to the story and it gave me a lot of food for thought. And I found myself closely following the emotional arc of the main character. It was also just such a quick read and brought me to tears,â€ she said.
The first four episodes of Deathâ€™s Game are available on Prime Video. The second part of the show will premiere on the streamer in January."
"Ask Ram Charan and Sobhita Dhulipala and theyâ€™d say it is better late than never. The two actors have teamed up for a charming new commercial where the duo play bride and groom.

"Screenwriter Gazal Dhaliwal, known for the Netflix show Mismatched, recently called out filmmaker Sandeep Reddy Vanga for taking the sole credit of writer for his latest film Animal. She penned a note on Instagram where she mentioned how some filmmakers have a â€œdeep-seated need of powerâ€ which makes them not give credit where it is due.
She wrote on Instagram, â€œI do want to share a seemingly-small insight I draw about the person behind the film from a seemingly-small fact. Specifically, from the point of view of a screenwriter.â€ Dhaliwal shared a screenshot from the Animal credits where Sandeep Reddy Vanga is referred to as the â€˜Writer, director, editorâ€ of the film.

The two filmmakers have been together for 12 years, have two children and collaborated on many films, including Barbie, which they co-wrote and Gerwig directed.

Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach wrote Barbie during the pandemic, not knowing if it would ever actually get made. In a â€™60 Minutesâ€™ interview from earlier this year Baumbach said that Gerwig signed them up to write it without telling him and he even tried to get out of it. His attempts, he laughed, were unsuccessful because â€œGreta was persistent and Greta saw something,â€ he said.
The film became a cultural phenomenon and the highest grosser of the year, with over $1.4 billion in ticket sales, as well as a presumed Oscar contender.

The first show of the Rajkumar Hirani film in India was at 5:55 am at Mumbaiâ€™s iconic single-screen theatre Gaiety Galaxy, and as the visuals from the cinema hall went viral on the internet, it looked nothing less than a celebration.

"Yash starrer KGF 2 clocked five years of its release today. Not only did the film become one of the highest-grossing Kannada movies ever, but it also outperformed big-budget Bollywood films with its popularity. The film, which released in 2018, clashed with Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Zero at the box-office. After five years, Hombale films are back with another pan-India film starring Prabhas and Prashanth Neel is all set to go head-to-head with Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Dunki. 
While the Yash-starrer emerged as a blockbuster, Zero failed to make waves at the box-office. Yash had previously opened up about the clash and had said that their decision of releasing the film alongside SRKâ€™s film was not â€˜intentional.â€™

"Most crime thrillers, at least in recent times, usually end on a â€œhighâ€ note with the previously elusive and unidentified culprit being apprehended by the infallible hero cop. But what happens to these culprits after that? Do they receive the deserved punishment? Are the victims granted timely justice? Or do these wrongdoers manipulate the system, tipping the scales in their favour, and resurface in society even more formidable?
As vital as the investigative phase is to a case, the trial holds equal, if not greater, importance as it ultimately determines the final verdict. However, observing this process unfold in a two to two-and-a-half-hour film may not be inherently engaging, which is why courtroom scenes in cinema tend to be exaggerated, sometimes even lacking coherence. Nevertheless, with his Mohanlal-starrer Neru, director Jeethu Joseph has made an attempt to navigate the realm of courtroom drama with an emphasis on accuracy yet without compromising emotional depth; but its effectiveness is somewhat questionable.

"Prabhas starrer Salaar will hit the screens worldwide on December 22. Meanwhile, reports of Salaar being a remake of director Prashanth Neelâ€™s Ugramm have been doing rounds on the internet. Now, the director has clarified that he wanted to retell the story of Ugramm because the 2014 film, starring Murali, failed at the box-office. 
In an interview with Kairam Vaashi, the director was indirectly asked if Salaar was a remake of Ugramm. The filmmaker said, â€œUgramm was made for theatres. It was made for the cinema halls and I always had that pain. Not to take away anything from KGF, the idea, the world building, it came to me from Ugramm itself. When Ugramm happened and I did not get what I wanted, I made a conscious decision that I am going to do something that will always fill the halls. And KGF did that for me.â€

"Filmmaker Prashanth Neelâ€™s next film Salaar, starring Prabhas is all set to release in theaters tomorrow. Ahead of the release, the filmmaker discussed the mental and physical stress that has been affecting him. He said that his demanding schedules have also impacted his personal life and revealed that he meets his kids once in three months. 
In an interview with Kairam Vaashi, Neel was asked about the physical stress he goes through while filming a movie. The director said, â€œPhysically very bad, it is a part of that stress. My personal has been not great, but that is something that I have accepted. Why would I have taken Salaar immediately after that (KGF)? That is a personal choice I made. My family also knows about it. I have not given enough time for my kids. I meet my kids once in three months, that too when they cry.  I immediately go. But I have chosen to do it. Itâ€™s not a penalty, itâ€™s a personal choice. I have been a bad father, bad husband, bad son, bad brother and a horrible friend. Everything I have sacrificed for cinema and what I want to get out of cinema.â€ (Sic)

"When Salaar dropped its first teaser, fans were convinced that the film surely belonged to the KGF universe as the colour palette of the movie was the same as Yashâ€™s KGF films. Even after the trailer came out, fans were looking for hints to prove that Rocky Bhai was going to appear in Salaar. While KGF and Salaarâ€™s director Prashanth Neel later stated that the worlds of both these movies were far apart, he has now explained the reason for the visual similarity between these films.
In a chat with SS Rajamouli on the YouTube channel of Hombale Films, Prashanth said that he has an â€œOCD with monochromeâ€. The director said that he realised the visual similarity between KGF and Salaar only after he started sharing the content of the film with the audience. â€œI have an OCD with monochrome and that is somehow reflecting in my movies, which I realised only after I put out Salaar trailer and teaser. I realised that very strongly. This has nothing to do with my DOP, it has nothing to do with my art director,â€ he said.

"Filmmaker Prashanth Neelâ€™s next film Salaar is all set to release in theatres on December 22. The Prabhas starrer is already making waves with an impressive advance collection. The filmmaker has shared that he isnâ€™t bothered when people compare his films and label them as repetitive. He said  that for him, itâ€™s all about business, and as long as he has entertained the audience, he doesnâ€™t concern himself with his reputation.
In an interview with Kairam Vaashi, Neel was asked about his fears before the release of the film. He said, â€œFor me it is always about money. Itâ€™s not fear about reputation or fear of repetitiveness. What I did in Ugram, I did in KGF; what I did in KGF I did in Salaar, I donâ€™t care about that. I am here only to entertain. If my box-office collection shows a good result, then why should I worry about myself. I donâ€™t think the paying audience is coming to judge me. They donâ€™t have time for that. I was carried away for a small period of time. I was like â€˜what about my reputation, everybody is saying Salaar is like KGF.â€™ But now I donâ€™t care. If you tell me â€˜the cinema was super, but it was a bit like KGFâ€™ that does not matter to me. I myself made KGF."

Speaking about working with Prabhas, Prithviraj told Bollywood Hungama, â€œPrabhas is one of the biggest stars of the country and probably the only person who does not know that is him. He is the nicest guy. Either he really does not know or he is putting up a brilliant performance. He does not know how big he is. I have spent 100 days with him and he checked on me everyday. He would ask, â€˜Shall I send some food? Are you okay?â€™ and he would ask this every actor on set.â€"
"Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Dunki Movie Review: In â€˜Dunkiâ€™, Shah Rukh Khan plays a soldier yet again this year after â€˜Pathaanâ€™ and â€˜Jawaanâ€™, but this third time around turns out to be unlucky: his vaunted first collaboration with Rajkumar Hirani is mostly a crashing bore.
â€˜Dunki maarnaâ€™ is a colloquialism for illegal migration. In the film, Hardyal Singh Dhillon aka Hardy (Shah Rukh Khan) is the catalyst which gets the Laltu threesome of Mannu (Taapsee Pannu), Buggu (Vikram Kochhar) and Balli (Anil Grover) going, through dangerous underwater and overland terrain in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, onwards to their dream destination, London.

"Actor Ajay Devgan, and filmmakers Rohit Shetty and Karan Johar reminisced about the good old days on the latest episode of Koffee with Karan. Ajay said that the current generation of film actors is too insecure, and recalled the brotherhood that members of the film industry shared with each other back in the day. He recalled a story narrated to him by his late father, Veeru Devgan, about the bond that directors Manoj Kumar and Raj Kapoor shared.
Asked about the changes that theyâ€™ve witnessed the industry undergo over the years, Ajay said, â€œIâ€™ve heard stories from my dad. In fact, I remember a story, Manoj saab made this film Purab Aur Paschim, and he invited Raj saab for the trial of the film. In the beginning of the film, the British rule gets over, and the Indian flag goes up. As soon as the Indian flag goes up, the film changed into colour; it was black and white (before that). Raj saab got up, walked out, and Manoj saab ran after him, asking, â€˜Whatâ€™s wrongâ€™. Raj saab said, â€˜I hate you, I donâ€™t want to watch this film. How could you think of this? I couldnâ€™t think of this. Your film is a superhit, Iâ€™m not watching any moreâ€™.â€

"Rohit Shetty is known to make likable entertainers that usually donâ€™t receive the best reviews from the critics. Now, on Koffee with Karan, when Rohit was asked if â€˜film reviews should be first reviewed by a jury of reviewersâ€™, the director said nodded in agreement and also said that no reviewer has ever said anything kind about his movies.
When Karan asked what the the â€˜rudest thingâ€™ he had ever heard from a critic, Rohit said, â€œThey have never spoken good about me, they are always rude to me.â€ Karan later asked him if â€˜films should make you thinkâ€™, and Rohit candidly replied, â€œGhanta. Films are to entertain. Nobody remembers the film or the story after a point.â€

"On the latest episode of Koffee with Karan, actor Ajay Devgn opened up about the hardships that his father, the late action director Veeru Devgan, faced in his life. He said that his father was a member of a street gang, and was spotted fighting on the street by a senior action director, who took him under his wing. On the same episode, Karan said that his own father, the late Yash Johar, would have found the nepotism debate laughable, because he knows the struggles he had to experience in order to give Karan a bright future.
Asked if his father got the appreciation that he deserved, Ajay said, â€œEventually, yes. He ran away from his home in Punjab when he was just 13. He came to Mumbai without a train ticket, was put behind bars, had no work, no food. Somebody helped him out, said that if he washes his cab, my father could sleep in it. He started from there, and eventually became a carpenter, and then a gangster in Sion Koliwada. They had gangs at that time, and gang wars.â€ Karan remarked, â€œOh, god!â€

A few people talking rubbish about you does not mean that the whole world thinks the same about you.â€ Rohit Shetty added, â€œEverybody is getting trolled.â€ Ajay emphasized the dual nature of social media, saying, â€œOtherwise, social media doesnâ€™t work.

Ajay was joined on the episode by his Singham and Golmaal director Rohit Shetty. The rapid fire round opened with Ajay firing a shot directly at Karan Johar, referencing their much-publicised feud in the mid-2010s. Ajay referred to Karan as his â€˜sworn enemyâ€™ in the film industry.
Asked who the more bankable star is between Shah Rukh and Salman Khan, Ajay replied, â€œBank balance wise, I think Shah Rukh.â€ Karan remarked, â€œYes, especially this year.â€ Shah Rukh has released three films in 2023, two of which, Pathaan and Jawan, have emerged as the biggest hits of his career; the third, Dunki, debuted in theatres on Thursday.

"Karan Johar hosted Ajay Devgn and Rohit Shetty on the latest episode of Koffee with Karan and during the episode, Ajay and Karan discussed their old feud that created a rift between them for years. The clash of Ajayâ€™s Shivaay and Karanâ€™s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil in the theatres led to a misunderstanding between the two after which they did not speak to each other for years.
During the rapid fire segment of the show, when Karan asked Ajay about his â€˜sworn enemyâ€™ in the film industry, Ajay laughed and said, â€œOnce upon a time, it was you,â€ and Karan looked shocked at the revelation. After the rapid fire, Karan addressed their disagreement and recalled that Ajay was â€œgraciousâ€ enough to move past their differences and never looked back. â€œWhatever the altercation was , and it was misunderstanding, misconception, we didnâ€™t speak, Kajol and I didnâ€™t speak. Iâ€™m sure he must have had a troubled time with his own wife because we are such close friends but he really was very gracious. We were in the same studio and I said I want to meet him because he was there and he agreed to meet me immediately,â€ Karan recalled.

"Zero is a wild film that imagines a classless India in which a small town dwarf gets with a rocket scientist and a movie star, rejects them both, goes to Mars, and returns. Starring Shah Rukh Khan, the movie includes a monkey, two cancelled weddings, and irrefutable proof that Abhay Deol and R Madhavan are palatable only in small doses.  Of course everybody hated it.
If the unexpected discourse around The Archies has shown one thing, itâ€™s this: Indian audiences, barring that one time, donâ€™t seem to have an appetite for earnestness any more; theyâ€™re far more interested in â€˜edgyâ€™ cinema. Perhaps this is a reaction to the endless hours of crime â€˜contentâ€™ that we consumed during the pandemic? Or perhaps itâ€™s just a natural response to the collective frustration that this country is feeling. In many ways, Zeroâ€™s failure foreshadowed the response that Zoya Akhtarâ€™s Archies was greeted to recently.

"Casual observers could be forgiven for believing that the entirety of Indian cinema is limited to big blockbusters, each more gung-ho than the last. While the countryâ€™s biggest male stars resorted to patriotism and violence to remain relevant this year (all at the cost of women, both in front of and behind the camera), our cinema appeared to collectively return to a past that we thought weâ€™d outgrown. Animal, Leo, Pathaan â€” even the titles screamed gruff masculinity. But as popular as these films were, they hardly represent the sheer diversity of our filmmaking.
For that, we must turn to a quieter corner of the cinematic landscape. This is a more accepting, empathetic, and effectively more ambitious space. The best Indian films of 2023 donâ€™t just represent who we are as a people right now, but also who we are capable of becoming. Theyâ€™re cautionary tales and tragedies, fables and fantasies; these are the best Indian movies of the year, in alphabetical order."
"Ananya Panday is a liver, a lover, and by her own definition, a nice person. But why did the audience not warm up to her instantly when she made her debut in 2019? Ananya says until very recently, she would be constantly seeking validation, an exhausting exercise that she has finally stopped.
Ananya, daughter of actor Chunky Pandey and Bhavana, made her screen debut with Karan Johar-backed Student of the Year 2. Her next few outings, Pati Patni Aur Woh and Khaali Peeli didnâ€™t really elevate her as an actor among the audience, until Shakun Batraâ€™s Gehraiyaan last year, which is where Ananya started standing on her own.

"Actor Mansi Taxak, who plays the youngest wife of Bobby Deolâ€™s character, Abrar, in the blockbuster film Animal, said that she doesnâ€™t agree with some of the filmâ€™s more controversial scenes, but as an actor, she canâ€™t judge her character for being a pushover. In Animal, Mansiâ€™s character is sexually violated by Abrar, and later, threatened at gunpoint by the filmâ€™s protagonist Ranvijay, played by Ranbir Kapoor.
As someone who has seen patriarchy up close while growing up in Haryana, Mansi said that she understands where certain characters are coming from, but she has no choice but to separate her personal beliefs from what she is required to do on screen. In an interview with Siddharth Kannan, Mansi also spoke about the filmâ€™s post-credits scene, in which her slain husbandâ€™s brother Aziz, who now looks like Ranvijay after plastic surgery, declares her as his new wife.

"Ranbir Kapoor is basking in the success of his controversial film Animal. Like many audience members who have praised Ranbirâ€™s work in the Sandeep Reddy Vanga film, the director himself recently expressed how he was left in awe after watching the actorâ€™s performance. Sandeep said that even though he was quite confident in Ranbir as he was a fan of his previous work, he was completely blown away when he saw the finished scenes at the editing table.
â€œIn the edit room, when I was watching from A to Z, not in a continuous flow but in bits and pieces, I used to get this feeling that â€˜what is happening with this guy?â€™ Because Ranbir played it so well, I have no words to express,â€ he shared with Galatta Plus. Sandeep then mentioned that he got a similar feeling when he watched Ranbir in Sanju and Rockstar.

"SS Rajamouli recently interviewed Prashanth Neel, Prabhas, and Prithviraj about their upcoming film Salaar. During the conversation, Prashanth said that Prabhas would not make any corrections to whatever he gave him, which made him wonder whether he was on the right path. However, Rajamouli said that Prabhas might come across as someone who doesnâ€™t understand, but in reality, he is shrewd.
Prashanth said, â€œWhen the hero says whatever I have written is fantastic, I go back and wonder whether this is enough. Thatâ€™s the worst part of working with Prabhas.â€ To this, Prabhas replied that he will keep saying things can be made better during Salaar Part 2.

"Sandeep Reddy Vanga is currently basking in the success of his latest film Animal. While the movie is being criticised for glorifying toxic masculinity and violence, it continues to mint money at the box office. In a recent interview, the filmmaker spoke about the equation between the filmâ€™s lead characters â€“ Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s Ranvijay and Rashmika Mandannaâ€™s Geetanjali â€“ and how women in his films are bold.
Speaking about how women initiate sex in both his films Arjun Reddy and Animal, Sandeep told Galatta Plus, â€œI never thought this. This is not deliberate. I didnâ€™t deliberately put the approach. See what discussion they had in the flight, other than you know, â€˜Donâ€™t talk about my father like that. What do you mean? You know my fatherâ€™s is a great father.â€™ With that line I wanted to show that this is a shift of discussion. Hardly they spoke about anything and now you see thereâ€™s a big argument happening. I thought that would be nice dramatic quotient.â€

"Drama is one word that was repeated the most in the recent conversation between SS Rajamouli, Prashanth Neel, Prabhas, and Prithviraj about Salaar Part 1: Ceasefire. The four stars kept talking about the importance of drama in commercial films, with Rajamouli even saying that Prabhas is apt for such a film.
He said, â€œDrama always works, and it works especially well with Prabhas. He doesnâ€™t have to do anything. He just stands there and immediately the emotions start pouring out of him. I always felt that whenever he stands thereâ€¦ whenever his character feels anger or doing whateverâ€¦ people feel for him. He is blessed with that face.â€"
"Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Animal is currently dominating the box office, despite facing criticism for its portrayal of gory violence and toxic masculinity. In a recent interview, the filmmaker discussed the movieâ€™s intense fight sequences, drawing inspiration from Quentin Tarantinoâ€™s Kill Bill. He also delved into the influence of the iconic 1972 crime drama, The Godfather, on his work.
Expressing his lifelong fascination with flawed characters in cinema, Sandeep told Galatta Plus, â€œWhatever films I liked in my childhood were all of flawed men. When I went to film school, I was exposed to flawed men watching the movies of David Fincher, Martin Scorsese and Stanley Kubrick. So, I felt like this is a zone in which I can tell stories.â€

"Actor Bobby Deol recently revealed that the final showdown in the blockbuster film Animal included a brief moment where his villainous character, Abrar, plants a kiss on ther filmâ€™s hero Ranvijay, played by Ranbir Kapoor. Bobby said that the scene was axed on the edit table by director Sandeep Reddy Vanga, who has now given more insights into his decision, and the kiss itself.
In an interview with Galatta Plus, he said, â€œYes, actually there was a kiss. Bobby will kiss Ranbir, a kiss on the cheek, and say, â€˜Bhai, I didnâ€™t even spend one day with my fatherâ€™, and heâ€™ll go back and open his zip. It was superb when we were shooting, but I felt like the kiss was diluting the zip. Why I removed it was because Bobby sir gave this expression with a smirk, and a tear falls down his cheek. I felt that was a bigger cinematic high than coming and kissing.â€

"The makers of Pankaj Tripathi-starrer Main Atal Hoon,the biopic of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, dropped the filmâ€™s trailer on Wednesday. The trailer suggests that the movie is the story of Vajpayeeâ€™s political career from his early days even though the text suggests that this is the story of the â€˜leader you know but the man you didnâ€™tâ€™.
The trailer touches upon the various chapters of recent Indian history starting from the Emergency to the Kargil war. Incidents like Ram Janmbhoomi, Pokhran, Lahore Bus Yatra are shown in the trailer but those who lived through the 1990s and 2000s would certainly be able to point out many other significant chapters that have not been covered here. Even though Pankaj Tripathi is known to be an ace performer, his choice in playing the famous political leader seem a little odd.

"Neliima Azeem, who is the mother of actors Shahid Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter, brought up her sons almost single-handedly and the actor-dancer is very proud of the way her kids have grown up to be confident and responsible adults. Both Shahid and Ishaan were very protective of their mother from a very young age and in a recent chat, Neliima shared an anecdote when a six-year old Shahid confronted a French man who was following his mother.
In a chat with Rashmi Uchil for the book Raising Stars, Neliima recalled the time when she was performing in Belgium. â€œI was performing in Belgium once and a French guy kept following me around. Shahid was all of six then. He stood up to that guy and told him, â€˜Before you talk to her, you will have to deal with me. Thatâ€™s my mother,'â€ she shared.
Neliima recalled another â€œaggressiveâ€ incident which was rather â€œunpleasantâ€ for her and even Ishaan, who was only three-and-a-half years old at the time, had the presence of mind to threaten the person by telling them that he would call the police. She recalled, â€œIshaan was equally astute. He was only 3 and a half years old when a rather unpleasant incident took place. He told the person who was getting aggressive with me, â€˜I am watching you. Should I call the police?â€™ Both my boys have been protective of me since a very early age.â€

Neliima Azeem said that she did not have the option to be a stay-at-home mom as she was a single mother and had to earn while raising her boys. â€œIt is a matter of privilege if you can choose not to work after having kids. I never had the option of not working,â€ she said and added that she was â€œthe breadwinner of the family mostly.â€ She shared, â€œBoys who are raised by working mothers generally tend to become more responsible, sensitive, and emotionally caring. They want to help out and ease the financial burden on their motherâ€™s shoulders.â€
In the past, Shahid Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter have opened up about being raised by a single mother and how it changed their outlook towards life.

"Ravi Teja is going through a rough patch. A lot of hope was pinned on Tiger Nageswara Rao as the movie kept with the trend of violent films. However, like many of Ravi Tejaâ€™s recent ventures, the action drama about dacoits failed to leave a mark. However, Ravi is relentless in his pursuit of a hit and he is gearing up for the release of a new film titled Eagle.
Going by the trailer, Eagle comes across as another attempt from the actor to stay relevant as he is playing the role of an assassin. Across the world, films about secret agents and assassins have become hot sellers. Ravi is taking a stab at it too.

"Five months after officially unveiling the title and cast of his sixth directorial, actor-filmmaker Vineeth Sreenivasan has announced the completion of the production of Varshangalkku Shesham (Years Later) and released its first look poster.
The poster features Pranav Mohanlal and Dhyan Sreenivasan standing on a platform with a large cutout of veteran Tamil actor and former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MG Ramachandran (fondly referred to as MGR) behind them. They appear to be imitating MGR by reciting his dialogues, with a few kids playfully teasing them in the foreground. Meanwhile, their attire, hairstyle and overall ambiance depicted suggest that the film, either entirely or partially, is set in a bygone era and hence the title â€œYears Laterâ€.
  View this post on Instagram
  A post shared by Vineeth Sreenivasan (@vineeth84)
What makes the poster even more intriguing is the fact that both Pranav and Dhyan are the sons of renowned actors Mohanlal and Sreenivasan, respectively, who took the industry by storm whenever they joined forces on-screen, with their most celebrated collaboration being in the Nadodikkattu films, portraying the characters Dasan and Vijayan.
Earlier in the day, Vineeth had shared a post announcing the conclusion of filming for Varshangalkku Shesham. â€œThis morning, at 2 am, on Dhyanâ€™s birthday, we finished shooting Varshangalkku Shesham. I am thankful to god that I have an army of people who are passionate about what they do. This is one film where i saw how beautiful the process of film making can be, if everyday and everything is planned meticulously. When you respect the light and when you respect nature, it gives you something precious. It gives you its magic. For me, Varshangalkku Shesham was all about realising this, yet again,â€ he wrote.

Apart from Pranav and Dhyan, the film also stars Aju Varghese, Kalyani Priyadarshan, Basil Joseph, Neeraj Madhav, Neeta Pillai, Arjun Lal, Nikhil Nair and Shaan Rahman. Nivin Pauly and director Vineeth Sreenivasan himself will also play key roles in Varshangalkku Shesham.

"Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Dunki is all set to release on Thursday and hours before the release of his third film of the year, King Khan took to X (formerly Twitter) and had a chat with his fans who seemed to be really excited for the film. One of his fans sent him a photo from his son AbRam Khanâ€™s school function where the young child posed like his father and melted the internet with his cuteness.
When the fan posted the photo on X and asked Shah Rukh to share his thoughts, the actor wrote, â€œHa ha our whole family loves hugs!! What to do now!! #DunkiTomorrow.â€ Another fan asked Shah Rukh about AbRamâ€™s thoughts on the film Dunki and the actor shared, â€œAbram has seen it and he keeps singing â€œI want to go to Lavatory!!! #Dunkiâ€

"The much-anticipated trailer of Sriram Raghavanâ€™s Merry Christmas, starring Katrina Kaif and Vijay Sethupathi in the lead roles, is finally here, and it asserts that the movie encapsulates everything one would expect and more from the filmmaker.
The 140-second trailer begins in a very Sriram Raghavan-ish way, presenting a split screen showcasing two mixer grinders â€” one grinding food items and the other tablets. Through a series of subsequent shots, the video sets the tone perfectly, highlighting the significance of cinema, carnivals, toys, the colour red and other Christmas-related elements in the film with retro visuals.

"Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Jawan was loved by his ardent fans and as the film was making waves, many pointed out that the dialogue where his character Vikram Rathore announces â€œBete ko haath lagane se pehleâ€¦â€ was an indirect dig at the Aryan Khan case. SRKâ€™s son Aryan was arrested for allegedly carrying drugs but was later cleared of all charges. Sameer Wankhede, the officer in charge of investigating Aryanâ€™s case, has now responded to the Jawan dialogue and called it â€œroadsideâ€.
In a chat with MensXP, Sameer was asked to respond to the dialogue and he said, â€œThis dialogue sounds very roadside to me. I neither watch movies nor listen to any dialogues. I donâ€™t know anything about this movie. But if someone has targeted this towards me, then I would like to respond to it in English.â€ He then quoted another writer and said, â€œI have burnt many houses and bridges and I have danced on those burnt houses and bridges so I fear no hell so please donâ€™t scare me.â€

Amit Sharma, Miraj Group CEO, expressed his confusion over the Salaar makers feeling â€˜hurtâ€™ by the situation, asserting that the â€œdecision of allotment of the number of shows should rest with the exhibitor.â€ He emphasised that exhibitors understand the audienceâ€™s pulse and are best positioned to determine how films should be allocated, given their knowledge of viewer preferences.

"The Indian cinema has witnessed some historic box office clashes over the years. This weekend the audience gets to choose between Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s comedy-drama Dunki and Prabhasâ€™ crime-thriller Salaar. People on the internet have started to pick sides in this battle of stars. While some are done watching bloodshed in films and want to watch Dunki, others canâ€™t take a chance of missing Salaar, which comes from brand Prashanth Neel of KGF fame. However, in this clash of big titles, film trade analysts are sure about a massive footfall at the box office during the holiday season.
Since Rajkumar Hirani helmed Dunki is a comedy-drama and belongs to a starkly different genre from Salaar, it will co-exist with the Prabhas starrer at the ticket counters. While in the northern states it will have an edge over Salaar, the southern states would be hard to conquer as not only Salaar, but Mohanlalâ€™s Neru, is also releasing in the theatres on December 21.

"Time and again, SS Rajamouli keeps proving that he is an out-and-out commercial filmmaker who strives to keep the audience entertained. While most filmmakers are moving past the concept of dance and item numbers in their films, the Baahubali director feels that people would miss it. In a special interview with Prashanth Neel, Prabhas, and Prithviraj, Rajamouli said that he is disappointed that Salaar doesnâ€™t have a dance number.
Rajamouli said that he is a huge fan of Shruti Haasanâ€™s dance and he keeps rewatching her songs on his phone and TV. Being such an ardent fan of her dance moves, Rajamouli is disappointed that Salaar Part 1: Ceasefire, which features Shruti in an important role, will not have a dance number. He said, â€œOne of the complaints that I have with Salaar is thatâ€¦ two songs I watch on my phone or TV are her party song from Race Gurram and Charusheela from Srimanthudu. I just love her dancing. Out in the corridor, you were saying that there are no duets in Salaar. You disappointed me (laughs). Jokes apart, people will be expecting something as the two are in the film.â€

"In the past decade or so, Zoya Akhtar, the younger of the Akhtar siblings and the daughter of famed lyricst and screenwriter Javed Akhtar has most definitively established herself as one of the most distinct voices to have emerged out of the Hindi film industry in this century. Her films have not only polarised the box-office but garnered critical acclaim. Whether she now proceeds to direct, write or just produce a film for the theatres or the digital space, one thing is for sure â€“ she is not a force to be ignored. Over the years, one has also come to distinguish the Zoya Akhtar school of film-making â€” there is, of course, the ensemble cast, the lavish production values, the clinically precise gaze of the camera and as some haters love to call it, an affinity to tell stories about the lives of the urban rich in India. But beyond the surface trappings of these details. Zoyaâ€™s films have always been driven by a deeply rounded human voice that has more often than not, opted to press a point home by dealing in quieter nuances as opposed to using  a sledgehammer.
I am, unfortunately, not of the generation that grew up reading the Archie comics. The Archie universe was something that came into my life in the form of stray and frayed comic books that I often found from my fatherâ€™s trunks during cleaning days. Although I spent much of my younger days immersing myself thoroughly into the Tintin and Astrix universe, the Archies was something I never really warmed up to. Until, the CBC show Riverdale, starring the inhumanly gorgeous cast of KJ Apa, Cole Sprouse, Camilla Mendes and Lili Reinhart walked into our lives. Earlier I have only heard of the perpetually hungry Jughead and the musician Archie who had the hots for the rich Veronica and the girl-next-door Betty. CBSâ€™s Riverdale, despite an eventual deep dive into aliens and time-travel, was initially rooted in a premise that attempted to take the archetypes of these familiar characters and ground them in a modern day reality â€“ which was oftentimes dark. Hence the announcement of The Archies, backed by Netflix and directed and helmed by Zoya Akhtar had me waiting with bated breath â€“ ever since its announcement.

"Hollywood star George Clooney says Matthew Perry had a hard time staying happy even after bagging one of the central characters on the long-running sitcom Friends.
Perry, who played Chandler Bing on the comedy series, died at the age of 54 on October 30 after being found unresponsive at his Pacific Palisades home here.
An autopsy report released last week said that Perry died from the â€œacute effects of ketamineâ€. The actor struggled with addiction for many years and had detailed it all in his 2022 memoir Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing.
ADVERTISEMENT
Also read | George Clooney on Playing Batman again: â€˜Donâ€™t think thereâ€™s enough for me to go backâ€™
Clooney, 62, said he knew Perry since he was a teenager. â€œI knew Matt when he was 16 years old. We used to play paddle tennis together. Heâ€™s about 10 years younger than me. And he was a great, funny, funny, funny kid,â€ the actor told Deadline in an interview.
Perry always wished to be on a sitcom, added Clooney, who had appeared as a guest star with his ER colleague Noah Wyle in the 17th episode of Friends season one.
â€œHe would say to us, I mean me, Richard Kind and Grant Heslov, â€˜I just want to get on a sitcom, man. I just want to get on a regular sitcom and I would be the happiest man on earthâ€™. And he got on probably one of the best ever. He wasnâ€™t happy. It didnâ€™t bring him joy or happiness or peace,â€ Clooney said.
Perry and Clooney tasted stardom around the same time in the early 1990s. At the time, Clooney was filming ER, while Perry was shooting for Friends at the same set of Warner Bros Studios in Burbank, California.
ADVERTISEMENT
The two shows went on to become the most popular shows in American television history. Due to his struggle with addiction, Perry found it hard to go on, Clooney said.
â€œWatching that go on on the lotâ€” we were at Warner Brothers, we were there right next to each otherâ€” it was hard to watch because we didnâ€™t know what was going through him. We just knew that he wasnâ€™t happy and I had no idea he was doing what, 12 Vicodin a day and all the stuff he talked about, all that heartbreaking stuff.â€
â€œAnd it also just tells you that success and money and all those things, it doesnâ€™t just automatically bring you happiness. You have to be happy with yourself and your life,â€ Clooney added. Clooney is currently promoting his upcoming directorial The Boys in the Boat.

"Though six years have passed since the release of Baahubali 2: The Conclusion, the SS Rajamouli film remains the second-highest-grossing Indian film worldwide. The profound impact of Rajamouliâ€™s franchise on visual art and its market persists, being recognised as the driving force behind numerous significant projects currently in development.
Meanwhile, the duology became a topic yet again at a recent event when Team Salaar, comprising actors Prabhas and Prithviraj Sukumaran and director Prashanth Neel, was interviewed by filmmaker SS Rajamouli for the production company Hombale Films. During the discussion, Prabhas, who portrayed the lead role in Baahubali, reflected on its impact on his life, while the other two also shared insights into how the duology served as a source of inspiration for them.
Dunki vs Salaar | Prabhasâ€™ film races past Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s comedy drama by Rs 2.4 crore
â€œI was in Italy once, and suddenly a man came up, pointed to me, and said â€˜Prabhas.â€™ He did not even speak English, yet he said â€˜Prabhasâ€™ and not â€˜Baahubali.â€™ In my mind, I thought about Rajamouli. One film and thatâ€™s it,â€ Prabhas said, prompting Prithviraj to add, â€œSome films are like that. They become way more than just a film. Baahubali is like a cultural phenomenon now. Itâ€™s way bigger than just a piece of cinema, and it means a lot, especially to people inside the industry.â€
ADVERTISEMENT
When Salaar director Prashanth Neel asked Rajamouli if it was true that he initially envisioned Baahubali as one film, the filmmaker acknowledged it and said, â€œInitially, it was planned as one film. As the writing progressed, it kept expanding. In the beginning, we envisioned it as a three-hour movie. However, gradually, it became evident that it would be four to five hours long if we put all the pieces together.â€

â€œThen came the idea of splitting it into two parts, which seemed crazy at the time since no one had that kind of concept, unlike now when almost all big films have a part two. So, I approached the producers, pointing out that due to the escalating budget, the only way to proceed with the movie was by splitting it into two. Prabhas was super excited, but he also insisted on leaving the decision to the producers. Once the producers gave their approval, we moved forward,â€ he added.
Mentioning that the interval block of Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is one of his favourites of all time, Neel asked Rajamouli if he foresaw the question â€œWhy did Kattappa kill Baahubali?â€ becoming as significant as it did. Asserting that he didnâ€™t expect it to gain such immense popularity, Rajamouli said, â€œWe knew it would be a shocking, beautiful moment, but I didnâ€™t anticipate it becoming that big. In fact, we didnâ€™t even coin that question, right? We noticed it on social media and adopted it later for promotional purposes.â€"
"Prashanth Neelâ€™s Prabhas-starrer Salaar Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire is set to go head-to-head with Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Dunki in a massive showdown like never before.

This marks the first collaboration between Neel and Prabhas, and according to actor Prithviraj, the film â€œcan even dwarf KGF 2â€. Hence, fans of both the â€˜Rebel starâ€™ and the KGF director are eagerly anticipating the filmâ€™s release on December 22.

"The Bigg Boss 17 house is currently buzzing with drama, with ongoing disputes between couples Vicky Jain-Ankita Lokhande and Aishwarya-Neil Bhatt. The recent entry of Munawar Faruquiâ€™s ex-girlfriend, Ayesha Khan, has only added more fuel to the fiery dynamics within the house. Amidst these conflicts, K-pop singer Aoora is getting limited screen time. Recently, the singerâ€™s family shared a statement, expressing their disappointment over the mockery the K-pop star is going through due to language barrier and the lack of screen time he is getting on the show.
Their statement was shared on X (formerly Twitter) account of Bigg Boss Tak. It read as, â€œAs his family and as someone who knows him well, we are saddened by how his kindness and innocence are being mocked inside the house. He is a kind and caring person who believes in anyone nice to him. We firmly believe good vibes and love transcend language barriers. He has been trying to connect with everyone, understand them, and learn more. It would be appreciated if everyone could respect his kindness and focus on enjoying the experience rather than engaging in mockery.â€"
"It is a bold move from the makers of Salaar Part 1: Ceasefire to not make any compromise with their film and settle for a UA certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification. While makers of such big-budget projects would aim to bring in all sets of audiences to theatres, Hombale Films will be missing out on family audiences and kids as the film is certified for adults only. SS Rajamouli, in a special interview, asked Prashanth Neel, Prabhas, and Prithviraj the same question.

Rajamouli asked Prashanth Neel his thoughts on Salaar getting an A certificate when Prabhas has so many children among his fans. Prashanth Neel said, â€œThe intention was never to make a movie that is so violent that it will get an A certificate. I have seen Telugu cinema for the past 25-30 years, and sometimes I feel my actions are pale in comparison to the action it had. But they have drawn out new guidelines and the censor officers also told me this is what it is. The cuts they were asking for (to give UA ceritificate)â€¦ they asked for a lot of cuts, and I was ready for them. But there were a couple of cuts, which I didnâ€™t want to do because I thought it wouldnâ€™t satisfy the drama. I was very disappointed. I almost sat very quitely for 15-20 minutes in front of them."
"From being dubbed â€˜the flag bearer of nepotismâ€˜ on his own chat show to weathering criticism for promoting star kids, Karan Johar has remained a prominent figure in the ongoing debate surrounding nepotism. The filmmaker and producer recently unveiled the teaser for his upcoming web series, titled Showtime, which delves into the same nepotism debate.
In the teaser, Emraan Hashmi portrays the â€˜badshaah of Bollywood,â€™ emphasising that those who discuss nepotism are often the same individuals eager to become insiders in the industry. He says, â€œNepotism ke mukhaute ke peeche aakhir mein har outsider insider banna chahta hai (In the end, every outsider wants to become an insider behind the facade of nepotism).â€ Mouni Roy takes on the role of an actor navigating various challenges, while Naseeruddin Shah appears as a savvy businessman asserting, â€œCinema dhandha nahi dharam hai saadda (Cinema is not my business but my religion).â€ The teaser also features other actors such as Vijay Raaz, Shriya Saran, and Rajeev Khandelwal.

"Archana Kalpathi, the CEO of AGS Entertainment, is yet again finding herself in the same situation as she was in 2018. Back then, the producer was bombarded with requests from Vijay fans for updates on Bigil, which was bankrolled by her production house. Now, as she has teamed up with Vijay again for a project, tentatively titled Thalapathy 68, she is having a feeling of deja vu. In a recent tweet, Archana dismissed rumours about the title of her upcoming movie and asked fans to be patient.
The â€˜title revealâ€™ has become an important marketing ploy for production houses to keep the fans engaged. The excitement for the project is built up by several speculations about the title, and the same is happening with Thalapathy 68. Rumours that the film is titled Puzzle are making the rounds on social media. Another speculation is that the film is named Boss. Dismissing both the rumours, Archana tweeted asking fans to keep calm and wait for the final reveal.

"About five years ago, actor Bradley Cooper made an impressive directorial debut with A Star is Born, which bagged multiple Oscar and Golden Globe nominations. Cooper also played its lead character of a famous country rock singer-songwriter, who is battling an alcohol and drug addiction and falls in love with an aspiring singer played by Lady Gaga. With Maestro, he repeats his magnificent feat as an actor-director as he explores the complicated relationship that music legend Leonard Bernstein (Cooper) shared with his wife, actor Felicia Montealegre Cohn Bernstein (Carey Mulligan).
At the heart of this ambitious biopic of Bernstein, a world-famous classical conductor and composer, is the deep bond he shared with Felicia even as he had multiple affairs with men. As Bernstein describes themselves, they remained â€œtwo little ducks in a pondâ€ through thick and thin. There is a dreamy quality to their romance, which unfolds in the Forties and is shown as a flashback, as it is captured in black-and-white. Their relationship also seems perfect in spite of his demanding career as a composer of several successful operas and Broadway musicals as well as transgressions. The cracks in their relationships appear over a period of time as Bernstein becomes a bigger celebrity, who hosts lavish parties, with people fawning over him.

"Not many actors have been fortunate enough to have a debut like Teja Sajja did back in 1998. At the tender age of four, he entered the film industry, portraying the role of Chiranjeeviâ€™s son in the superhit movie Choodalani Vundi. Despite lacking any prior connections in Tollywood, young Teja endeared himself to many soon and went on to appear as a child artist in several movies, alongside big stars such as Daggubati Venkatesh, Nagarjuna Akkineni, Pawan Kalyan, Prabhas, Mahesh Babu, Allu Arjun, and NT Rama Rao Jr.
After making his debut as a lead actor in Prasanth Varmaâ€™s Zombie Reddy (2021) and headlining two more movies the same year, Teja Sajja is now gearing up for the grand release of his big-budget superhero film Hanuman. Helmed by Zombie Reddy director Prasanth Varma, the film also stars Amritha Aiyer, Varalaxmi Sarathkumar, Vinay Rai, Raj Deepak Shetty, and Samuthirakani in key roles.

"Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga spoke about Bobby Deolâ€™s character Abrar in his critically panned film Animal, and explained why he is a Muslim even though he belongs to the same family as Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s Ranvijay, who is a Sikh. In an interview, he said that people often undergo conversions after having experienced setbacks, and thatâ€™s what Abrar did. It also gave him, Vanga, an excuse to design Abrar as a character who has multiple wives.
Speaking to Galatta Plus, Vanga said that vulnerable people are more likely to turn to religion and superstition, and that he has seen it happen in real life. In the film, Abrar is traumatised after the death of his grandfather, because of which he gies mute. Later, when his brother is killed, he goes on a warpath against Ranvijay. It is later revealed that they are related.

"Late actor Sushant Singh Rajput and his Pavitra Rishta co-actor Ankita Lokhande dated each other for seven years before going their separate ways. Ankita, who is currently a contestant on Bigg Boss 17, often talks about their relationship and break-up on the show. In the latest episode of the TV reality show, Ankita shared that she waited for Sushant to return to her even after two years of their breakup.
Ankita revealed in Tuesdayâ€™s episode of Bigg Boss 17 that she didnâ€™t tell anyone about her breakup with Sushant for two years as she hoped he would come back to her. â€œBahut baar banda batata nahi hai break-up ke baare main kyunki ussko lagta hai ki shayad wapas relationship thik hojaye. Ek hope rehti hai yaar. (Many times people donâ€™t reveal their breakup in the hope of reviving the relationship. I was also hopeful). For two years, I didnâ€™t want anyone to know about my breakup.â€"
"Actor Bobby Deolâ€™s turn as Abrar Haque in Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s latest hit Animal has brought him into the limelight. He is being appreciated for his performance and showered with immense love from his fans. Vanga had thought about casting Bobby as the villain of his film right from the time he conceptualised the climax. In a new interview, the filmmaker shared why he cast Bobby in Animal and why he was introduced in the film after almost two and a half hours.
Vanga told Connect FM Canada, â€œRight from the beginning I had this thing in mind that the hero and the villain would remove their shirts and fight on the runway. So, when I imagined that, I wanted someone macho who is broader than Ranbir and more powerful than him. I could not think of anyone but Bobby sir.â€
To play Abrar, Bobby Deol did a lot of work on himself to achieve a chiselled physique. His fitness trainer had earlier revealed that the actor dedicated four months to achieve his ripped body. The climax scene of the film had him and Ranbir fighting on the runway of a London airport, shirtless.

During the interview, Vanga revealed that he kept the viewers waiting for the villain even 2 hours into the film because he didnâ€™t want a â€˜routineâ€™ entry of his villain. He shared, â€œEverybody knew from the teaser and trailer that Bobby Deol is the villain and I knew they were going to wait for him. So, from the beginning, right after 15 minutes into the film, you know there is a tension about the villain but we do not see his face.â€
The filmmaker continued, â€œEven after the interval, I thought I can open him but I thought it is a very routine way to open the villain in a film. So, I made the audience wait for almost 28-30 minutes and then I introduced him as a bridegroom. I always wanted to show that Ranbir is in a very down phase whereas the villain is having fun and getting married for the third time. I wanted to show the difference and it worked.â€

"Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga dismissed the suggestion that he and his films are misogynistic in nature. The backlash against his brand of cinema has only increased with each new film. What began as minor criticism for Arjun Reddy turned into a full-fledged controversy for its Hindi remake, Kabir Singh, and has now become even bigger with the release of Animal. Vanga said that the criticism doesnâ€™t bother him, as he launched into a rant against critics in a new interview.
Speaking to Galatta Plus, the filmmaker was asked about the allegations of misogyny that have been leveled against him. â€œMisogyny is the disrespect of women, thatâ€™s the actual definition. So, no. Even Kabir Singh, even Animal, even me as a personâ€¦ I always feel my production companyâ€™s name is Bhadrakali Productions, I donâ€™t know why people feel I disrespect (women). Not people, just these 15-20 jokers. Itâ€™s the wrong word to use (to describe) Kabir Singh and Animal,â€ he said.

"Filmmaker Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s latest film Animal is making noise for many things, one of them being its music. Bobby Deolâ€™s entry song â€œJamal Kuduâ€ and war cry â€œArjan Vaillyâ€, which has Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s character Ranvijay on a killing spree, are among the most popular songs from the filmâ€™s soundtrack. In a latest interview, Vanga revealed that the song â€˜Arjan Vaillyâ€™ existed on YouTube for five years before he took notice of it, with the same lyrics, voice, and tune. But it never caught the attention of the audience.
Vanga, while speaking to Connect FM Canada, spoke about the importance of music to him. He said he cannot go ahead with his story if he is unaware of the music he will be playing. Talking about the placement of â€˜Arjan Vaillyâ€™ in the movie, the filmmaker explained, â€œWhen the axe fight is happening, I wanted a song. I have never done a lip-sync song. I wanted a full rageful, courageous song that too, the guys (who play Ranbirâ€™s cousins and are standing at the back in the song) are from â€˜pind (village)â€™, in Punjabi.â€

"Actor Bijay J Anand, who featured in Prabhas starrer Adipurush, says the film at its core was an â€œinnovative experimentâ€ that dared to go beyond the conventional imagery of the gods, thanks to filmmaker Om Rautâ€™s vision.
Adipurush, a retelling of the epic Ramayana, was billed as one of the biggest films of all times but ended up courting multiple controversies due to its poor writing, bad VFX and character design. The film, also starring Kriti Sanon and Saif Ali Khan, was a box office disaster.

"Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga said that he pre-empted the criticism that his new film, the blockbuster Animal, has received. In an interview, Vanga said that he would discuss whatâ€™s coming with actor Ranbir Kapoor, and was sure that the backlash against Animal would be stronger than the one against his previous film, Kabir Singh. The director identified his critics, and said that they should go teach English in China, because beyond their use of the language, he finds little of value in their reviews. In the same breath, he also called them â€˜illiterate and uneducatedâ€™.
In an interview with Connect FM Canada, Vanga said that he isnâ€™t bothered by the criticism because itâ€™s not being done â€˜in the right wayâ€™. He said that certain detractors are focusing on one or two points, and not viewing the film in totality. â€œIn a way, I understood their mental status and their IQâ€¦ If morality comes into the picture, then you canâ€™t make this film,â€ he said. Animal has been panned for its depiction of toxic masculinity.

"The Christmas holiday weekend is up for a clash of the titans at the Indian box office as Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s comedy-drama Dunki and Prabhasâ€™ crime-thriller Salaar arrive in the theatres just a day apart from each other. While Dunki releases on December 21, Salaar will hit the theatres on December 22. The advance ticket sales for both films began recently, and the audience is showing immense interest in both.
However, the first preference of the moviegoers seems to be Salaar as it has left behind SRKâ€™s Dunki. The Prashanth Neel helmed drama has already done a business of Rs 12.67 crore with the sale of 5,77,406 tickets for 6439 shows across the country. Dunki has so far managed to sell 3,60,508 tickets for 12608 shows and has earned Rs 10.26 crore. Dunki outperformed Salaar until Tuesday, but the tables turned within a matter of a day.

The moviegoers in the Telugu-speaking belt of the country are most excited about Salaar as the Telugu version of the film has earned Rs 8.78 crore from the sale of 3,82,617 tickets. The Hindi version of the film follows with Rs 1.74 crore coming from the region. Malayalam-speaking states are showing an upward trend in the sale of tickets for Salaar. 8,72,77 tickets have been sold for 978 shows bringing in Rs 1.2 crore.

Shah Rukh Khan, who has already given two hits during the year with Pathaan and Jawan, still has got the cinephiles excited for his film. People in Maharashtra are most excited to watch Dunki as their share to the total earnings of the film on Day 1 stands to be Rs 1.81 crore so far, followed by Delhi (Rs 1.55 crore) and West Bengal (Rs 1.22 crore). If SRK would strike a hattrick of hits on Thursday, it would be known soon.

Meanwhile, the Dunki team has told the distributors that they donâ€™t want to share the screen with Salaar and want all four shows for themselves. And, if they wonâ€™t be given all four shows, they donâ€™t want any.
Dunki, unlike the previous two Shah Rukh Khan films Pathaan and Jawan, wonâ€™t release in dubbed languages. Salaar will have a pan-India opening in Telugu, Tamil, Hindi, Kannada and Malayalam.

"The Ranbir Kapoor-starrer Animal, directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, is cooling down at the box office after a spectacular run that trampled over poor reviews, backlash, and other obstacles such as a long run time and an A rating. On its 19th day of release, the movie made Rs 5 crore in India, according to industry tracker Sacnilk, taking its total domestic collections to Rs 522 crore. The movie should pass Sunny Deolâ€™s Gadar 2 (Rs 525 crore) on the all-time chart today, and will then set its sights on passing Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Pathaan (Rs 543 crore).
Animal opened to huge numbers, and has since made nearly Rs 850 crore globally, which puts it on the number three spot for Indian movies this year, behind Pathaan and Jawan. Both those blockbusters grossed over Rs 1000 crore in their theatrical runs, a number that looks out of reach for Animal, considering the dual competition itâ€™ll face this week. Shah Rukhâ€™s third film of the year, Dunki, will debut on Thursday, followed by Prabhasâ€™ Salaar on Friday.

"Unlike last year, the box office hits didnâ€™t end up becoming the criticsâ€™ favourites this time around. Vijayâ€™s Varisu and Leo, and Rajinikanthâ€™s Jailer might have broken records when it came to collections, but these films are unlikely to make it to â€˜best ofâ€™ lists this year. Though they were good entertainers, Tamil cinema did offer more than just two-and-a-half hours of escapism. While quality films were sporadic, there were gems like the long-delayed Koozhangal and the devastating Chittha. In no particular order, hereâ€™s a list of Tamil films that impressed in 2023.

Por Thozhil
ADVERTISEMENT
This will be a part of almost all the top ten lists of 2023, as the film effortlessly won the hearts of Tamil audiences and critics. The buddy cop-thriller explored all the tropes of the sub-genre and still managed to stay fresh. The film, which follows a novice police officer (Ashok Slevan) and a veteran (Sarathkumar) who are on the trail of a serial killer in Trichy, features gripping moments and effective twists. Director Vignesh Raja manages to deliver the message subtly and without compromising the craft. 
Jigarthanda DoubleX
Karthik Subbarajâ€™s return to the silver screen with Jigarthanda DoubleX has restored his position as one of the most promising filmmakers of Tamil cinema. Inspired by Spaghetti Westerns, Kartik has formed a genre of his own, which he calls â€˜Pandya Westernâ€™. Despite several twists in the film, it remains captivating thanks to the excellent execution and superlative performances by SJ Suryah and Raghava Lawrence. 
Viduthalai Part 1
ADVERTISEMENT
Vetrimaaranâ€™s Viduthalai Part 1 is a gut-wrenching tale about a remote tribal village that suffers as a police camp is set up to hunt an alleged terrorist Vaathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi). The story unravels from the perspective of a newly-appointed constable, who is not able to choose whatâ€™s right in the grand scheme of things. An anti-establishment film â€” a rare breed in the current political scenario in India â€” Viduthalai is about the oppressed and the oppressor. Never an easy watch, it makes for essential viewing.
Good Night
2022 had Thiruchitrambalam proving that a blockbuster doesnâ€™t always need to have an action hero, huge budget and over-the-top action sequences. Good Night, directed by Vinayak Chandrasekaran, might not be as successful as Dhanushâ€™s romantic drama, but it managed to become a brilliant box-office success story. The story of a protagonist suffering from a snoring issue that puts his marriage in jeopardy was as intriguing as it was enjoyable. With brilliant performances from Manikandan and Meetha Raghunath, director Vinayak Chandrasekaran proved that thereâ€™s more to Tamil cinema than just â€˜superstarsâ€™. 
Dada
ADVERTISEMENT
Like Good Night, Dada is another small film that emerged as a winner this year. A moving tale about a single alcoholic father taking care of his son and redeeming himself was well-executed by director Ganesh K Babu. With superlative performances by Kavin and Aparna Das, the film can be accused of being bit contrived, but it manages to win you over with its emotional quotient.
Maamannan
Maamannan might not be the best film of Mari Selvaraj, but the Vadivelu and Udhaynidhi Stalin starrer deserves a place on the list. A tale of the titular hero, an MLA from an underprivileged caste, is perhaps the first film to explore the caste politics that exists inside an anti-caste party. Fahad Faasil, Udhaynidhi and Vadivelu together made this film work despite the screenplay taking an easy way out towards the end. Vadivelu as a Dalit politician stands out in an optimistic tale where good once again wins over evil against all odds.
Maaveeran
ADVERTISEMENT
Perhaps the most ambitious film of the year in terms of idea, Maaveeran gave Tamil cinema its original superhero. A voice in the head of a coward cartoonist Sathya (Sivakarthikeyan) makes him into a superhero. The voice foretells things, which makes Sathya an invincible fighter as he can guess the next move of his enemies. Maaveeran is fun and thought-proving at the same time, like director Madonne Ashwinâ€™s last film Mandela.
Chittha
Easily the most haunting and difficult movie to watch this year, director SU Arun Kumarâ€™s Chittha is about victims of pedophilia and the recourse one should take. It removes our focus from punishing the monsters and directs it towards the wounded. Siddharth has given it all to this devastating story, and it is by far the most sensitive mainstream movie about the least-explored subject. The film follows the story of an uncle and his niece. When the latter goes missing, the uncle wages war against the world to bring her back. The film has the incredible pace of a gripping thriller and the heart of a brilliant emotional drama.     
Ponniyin Selvan 2
ADVERTISEMENT
Mani Ratnam deviated majorly from the source material in the second part of his magnum opus, which worked in favour of the film. While the conclusion to the epic story had a lot of shortcomings such as the fragmented screenplay and the information overload, one has to cut some slack for the directorâ€™s vision and refusal to churn out one â€˜mass momentâ€™ after the other. PS 1 and PS 2 might not be perfect films, but they lay a strong foundation for future literary adaptations in Tamil.
Koozhangal
Though the film finished its festival run and became the first Tamil film to win the top prize at the Rotterdam Film Festival, it was released to the public only this year. Directed by PS Vinothraj, Koozhangal is an indie film about the long walk of an angry man in search of his wife, as he is accompanied by his tormented son. The film would open a lot of doors to anyone who hasnâ€™t had a taste of world cinema. Koozhangal would go down in history as not just the best film of 2023 but of Tamil cinema of all time. "
"Filmmaker Prashanth Neel says movies like his KGF franchise that organically travel across the country do well, a phenomenon he hopes is repeated with his latest directorial Salaar: Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire. Neel and Yash, the lead star of KGF series, rose to national prominence after the success of KGF: Chapter 1, the 2018 Kannada period action film. Its 2022 follow-up, KGF: Chapter 2 also starred Bollywood actors Raveena Tandon and Sanjay Dutt in key roles.
The director, who made his debut with 2014â€™s Ugramm, said he never plans his films as pan-India projects.
â€œIâ€™ve written a story and Iâ€™ve executed it. I donâ€™t know if it (â€˜Salaarâ€™) is going to be a pan-India movie or not. But if it becomes a pan-India movie, then thatâ€™s an absolute bonus for all of us. Like, â€˜KGFâ€™ happened very organically.
â€œMovies that happen organically always do well. You canâ€™t plan to make a pan-India movie, you canâ€™t plan and say that Iâ€™m going to bring these actors from this industry to make it a pan-India movie. It doesnâ€™t work like that,â€ Neel told PTI in an interview here.

Salaar revolves around two friends Deva and Vardha, played by Prabhas and Prithviraj Sukumaran, who end up becoming arch rivals. It will be released on Friday.
The 43-year-old director said the journey of the film started over 15 years ago.
â€œIt was an idea that was in my head. But it needed a very big budget. So, I made my first film â€˜Ugrammâ€™, then I made â€˜KGFâ€™. I was occupied with â€˜KGFâ€™ for almost eight years. During COVID-19, I narrated this subject (â€˜Salaarâ€™) to Prabhas sir and he agreed to do it,â€ he recalled. The USP of Salaar is an emotion between two friends and how this emotion translates to violence forms the core of the story, Neel said.

According to the director, equal importance should be given to the story and the characters in big-budget films. â€œWe make a movie to tell a story and we want the right characters, right actors to portray every role. Thereâ€™s a commercial aspect with a star and we get bigger budgets to do what we want. But the criteria is the same that this is the character, it is not the hero who is playing the hero because if we think like that then we have lost the battle,â€ he added.
With Salaar, Neel said his aim was for Prabhas (Baahubali) to shed his superstar persona. â€œThere was never a pressure to make â€˜Salaarâ€™. The idea is to make sure that the actor looks like a character. You donâ€™t want to show Prabhas as Prabhas, you want to show him as a character and I tried our best to do something like that,â€ he said.
While the director acknowledged that Prabhas has had a difficult run at the box office with his recent releases Adipurush and Radhe Shyam, he said a star can always bounce back after a hit film. â€œPrabhas is a big star. After â€˜Baahubaliâ€™, he became the biggest star. People are not going to forget something like that. Stars have always been stars; they can have one flop or 20 flops, they just need to give one hit. Recently, Shah Rukh Khan showed us that a star is always a star, thereâ€™s no denying that,â€ Neel added.
A box office showdown is expected between Salaar and Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s Dunki. The latter, starring Shah Rukh Khan, will hit the screens a day before Salaar on Thursday. About the release, Neel said he doesnâ€™t meddle in the business aspect of a movie. â€œI donâ€™t get involved in the logistics of what happens after the movie is ready. My brief is Iâ€™ve to make a movie on a given budget and Iâ€™ve to give it to them at a time that they want to release,â€ he said.

The filmmaker said he has utmost respect for Hirani and Shah Rukh. â€œI loved whatever they put out (referring to assets of â€˜Dunkiâ€™). People always want to see the most human thing in any trailer or teaser, so we try to do that. Even in the larger-than-life movies we try to do that.â€
Produced by Hombale Films, Salaar also stars Shruti Haasan, Eshwari Rao, Jagapathi Babu and Sriya Reddy."

"Alia Bhatt grew up in the world of movies as her father Mahesh Bhatt is a filmmaker and mother Soni Razdan is an actor. Even though Aliaâ€™s life looked luxurious to others, her mother recalled that she gave her children a â€œtypical middle-class upbringingâ€ as there was â€œnever any excess money.â€
In a chat with Rashmi Uchil for her book Raising Stars: The Challenges and Joys of Being A Bollywood Parent, Soni recalled an incident when she was traveling to Dubai with her daughters Alia and Shaheen but since they could not afford three business-class tickets, she made her kids travel in economy. â€œOnce, we were travelling to Dubai and could not afford three business-class tickets. I told my children, â€˜I will travel first class, and you guys travel economy.â€™ They made a face. When I went to check on them, I saw the lady in the seat right in front of them had reclined her seat, and these children had hardly any space in front of them. I told my children, â€˜Why donâ€™t you ask her to straighten her seat? Are you guys okay?â€™ They were miffed and retorted, â€˜Why are you asking us how we are doing? We will not tell her anything.â€™ The lady in front of them was a senior citizen and they felt bad telling her to straighten her seat. It wasnâ€™t a big deal at all.â€

In an interview, she revealed the distressing incident of facing discrimination during the process.
Speaking to Hindustan Times, Charu said, â€œI took a break for one hour between shoots to attend a society meeting of my soon to be new house. Everything was finalised and had even submitted the token money. The members of the committee were mostly males, and there was only one female.â€
She added, â€œShe asked me, â€˜How many people will live here?â€™ I told her that it would be me, my daughter, and two maids. She said, â€˜No, hum single mothers ko ghar nahi dete (No, we donâ€™t rent home to single mothers).â€™ I asked her the reason, but she said she doesnâ€™t want to go there or entertain any further discussions on this. She was very rude to me. I was trying to convince her.â€

"Hollywood star George Clooney has ruled out the possibility of him playing superhero Batman on the big screen again.
The actor had famously played Bruce Wayne aka The Batman in filmmaker Joel Schumacherâ€™s 1997 movie Batman & Robin, which performed abysmally at the box office and was universally panned by critics and fans.
George Clooney recently appeared as the Caped Crusader in the final moments of Andy Muschiettiâ€™s The Flash, the 2023 Warner Bros/DC film starring Ezra Miller. At the premiere of his latest directorial effort The Boys in the Boat, the actor was asked whether he plans to play the superhero again.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œI do not think thereâ€™s enough drugs in the world for me to go back,â€ the 62-year-old actor told Entertainment Tonight.
About his cameo in The Flash, George Clooney said there was a demand from fans to see him as the iconic superhero.

George Clooneyâ€™s latest directorial effort The Boys in the Boat, starring Callum Turner and Joel Edgerton, is based on the 2013 book of the same name by Daniel James Brown. The film will be released in the US on December 25.

"Bollywood actor Boman Irani has opened up about a topic that has been the subject of debate across the world: underpaid writers. Only recently Writers Guild of America went on a historic strike for about 148 days for fair pay and many other reasons. While the Indian film industry is far behind in recognising writers as an important component of filmmaking, the discourse has started, and Boman Irani has come out with a rather bold statement about how writers have to become good enough to demand good income for their work.
Speaking to Jist Unscripted, Boman said, â€œI am going to make a bit of a controversial statement. It is said writers are not getting their due. Yes, they are not. Writers are not paid enough. Yes, they are not. But you have to become worthy. Good writing should become so common that we canâ€™t operate without these guys. You should become worthy. There are fantastic writers but they are few. When you say we are not getting our dueâ€¦ you have to write well. If you give me a watertight script, everything goes well. Even an average director will make a good film if you have a good script. So, the writers become the hero.â€

"Bobby Deolâ€™s striking appearance in the trailer of Animal left a lasting impression, generating significant buzz. Following the filmâ€™s theatrical release, Bobbyâ€™s fan base has reached new heights, with enthusiasts emulating his dance moves in Instagram reels. In a recent interview, Bobby discussed grappling with imposter syndrome during the making of Animal and revealed his doubts about his performance, despite receiving praise from the filmâ€™s director, Sandeep Reddy Vanga.
Speaking at the The Film Companion Actorsâ€™ Adda, Bobby shared a behind-the scene anecdote from the sets of Animal and said, â€œThe scene where I put the finger on my mouth. I was just told what to do and speak in the sign language. I was like, â€˜Okay, fine.â€™ I knew the dialogue because I had to practice it in sign language.â€
He continued, â€œSo, when I just went and did that shot, I donâ€™t want to boast but it was a one take shot and everybody started clapping and I was like, â€˜Maine kya kia, why are people clapping?â€™ Sandeep comes to me and says, â€˜Sir, that was an award winning shot.â€™ I was like, â€˜I am working for so many years, no actor has told me this thing.â€™ I was happy inside but I was also thinking that maybe I am not able to do it and thatâ€™s why he is, â€˜What a shot.â€™ So this is what I experienced.

"Hombale Films are not only making those big-budget blockbusters costing hundreds of crores, but they are also aiming to capture the mid-level and small budget films market. An example is Keerthy Sureshâ€™s upcoming film Raghuthatha, which promises to be a comedy-drama. A glimpse of the film was released today by the makers.
The promo only features a vintage-looking cinema poster of Keerthy in half-saree. The poster is being carried through a busy market, and in the background, a narrator announces the details of the film.
Hereâ€™s a glimpse of Raghuthatha:

Directed by Suman Kumar, Raghuthatha also stars M S Bhaskar, Devadarshini, Ravindra Vijay, Anandsami and Rajesh Balakrishnan. Sean Roldan is composing the music for the film, while Yamini Yagnamurthy is handling the camera. The makers have called the movie â€œa rollicking, hilarious adventureâ€.
ADVERTISEMENT
Raghuthatha, the title of the film, is inspired by the popular comedy sequence from Bhagyarajâ€™s Indru Poi Naalai Vaa. The scene involves a Hindi teacher trying to teach the sentence, â€œEk gaav mein ek kisaan rahata tha (A farmer lived in a village).â€ The reluctant and spoilt student keeps repeating the sentence as â€˜Raghu thathaâ€™ which, in Tamil, means Raghuâ€™s grandfather. The sequence was a huge hit back then and has remained a part of Tamil pop culture.
Meanwhile, Hombale Filmsâ€™ biggest project Salaar Part 1: Ceasefire is all set to be released on December 22 across the world in multiple languages. Starring Prabhas and directed by Prashanth Neel, the film also has Prithviraj in the lead role."

Here, Atal is seen engrossed in a conversation with LK Advani as they discuss their political future.

The rest of the cast of the film is yet to be announced. Main Atal Hoon has been directed by Ravi Jadhav, who has previously directed National Award-winning Marathi films Natarang, Balgandharva and Balak Palak. He also recently directed the Sushmita Sen-led JioCinema series Taali.

Mari said, â€œNo one expected such a devastating disaster here. This place is dependent on rivers. The problem with saving people is that the villages are cut off from each other. People have found refuge on top of trees and houses. So it has become hard to go in and rescue all of them. There are villages which are totally cut off where even boats canâ€™t go in. About 12 villages are like that. They were completely cut off for the past two days. They havenâ€™t had access to food and communication. We rarely get a message from those areas.

To achieve this, she has embraced a variety of roles in the last few years, consistently pushing boundaries, even if it meant doing just one or two projects annually.
Jeo Babyâ€™s Kaathalâ€”The Core, in which she appeared alongside Malayalam superstar Mammootty, is a testament to her unconventional movie choices, as the film revolves around a homosexual man and a wifeâ€™s attempts to help him come out to society.

Meanwhile, she recently elaborated on her film choices and asserted that there are a lot of offers she says no to, while maintaining that even amidst all this, she rarely received genuinely diverse characters in Tamil industry.

â€œAs far as women are concerned, itâ€™s a different battle altogether, especially down South. As you turn 35-40, there are fewer options. If youâ€™re doing well, then you are typecasted as well. In my case, I did a lot of good roles. I was a crusader who ran a government school in one film and a housewife in another. I did everything good there. But there was no room for grey. So I opted to do a Malayalam film instead, and that brought me here,â€ she said while taking part in Film Companion Actorsâ€™ Adda.

â€œMy journey is all through Tamil, but a Malayalam film brought me here, sitting with such lovely actors on this platform. So, I guess you have to flow; you canâ€™t be stagnant and swim in a pond. Thereâ€™s an ocean out there. Itâ€™s time we all got in there, dived, and just discovered whatâ€™s happening.
â€œFor women, you have to say no to a lot of things, especially in the realm of popular cinema because 90 per cent of the time, it doesnâ€™t make sense what the girls are doing there. So, I have consciously taken this decision that when women come out after watching my films, they should have their heads held high. Itâ€™s a journey. It has its ups and downs, but your choice is what determines it,â€ she added.â€

Chithha actor-producer Siddharth on lessons he learnt from Kamal Haasan
During the same conversation, Chithha actor-producer Siddharth reflected on the profound influence of Kamal Haasan and his films on him. He emphasised that no one else could parallel the impact the Tamil superstar had on the industry, consistently contributing to its evolution.

Mentioning that he frequently seeks advice from Kamal Haasan and his filmmaking mentor Mani Ratnam regarding how they overcame fear to make crucial decisions, Siddharth said, â€œIf not for Kamal Haasan, there is a high chance that I would not have existed as an actor. We canâ€™t even scratch the surface of what he was risking when he did what he was doing. The way I compliment Mammootty for doing Kaathal â€“ The Core at his age now, I can compliment Kamal for doing all that he has done in the past 40 years.â€
â€œThatâ€™s what I owe himâ€¦ [The lessons he taught me on how] to live with even less fear going forward and choose my content and to keep reiterating to myself that I want to be an actor, not a star,â€ he added."
"Director Prashanth Varma, whose last feature film was a zombie comedy, is set to launch a â€˜cinematic universeâ€™ named after himself with the upcoming film Hanuman. The superhero movie, which has liberal mythological overtones, got a first trailer on Tuesday. The three minute trailer shows the CGI world that Varma has created for the movie, whose script has been credited to not a human being, but something called â€˜Scriptsvilleâ€™.
The trailer begins with an underwater shot, and text on the screen that reads, â€œInspired from the itihasas of Akhand Bharat.â€ A man swims towards a glowing orb, while shlokas are recited in the background. We then cut to the exterior, where a sweeping shot glides over a river, between ravines, and stops at the foot of a Hanuman statue. We then see actor Teja Sajja in what appears to be a recreation of Jr NTRâ€™s first scene in the film RRR. The character chases after a cheetah, and then poses under an Indian flag."
"Actor Manoj Bajpayee spoke about the thrills and challenges of improvising on set, but said that no matter what you do as an actor, you must remember to never change a single word while giving Amitabh Bachchan his cues during a shot. Manoj has worked with the legendary actor on several occasions, and said that Amitabh rigorously rehearses his lines in advance. In an interview, Manoj said that he also enjoys rehearsing, because he can improvise only if he knows his lines perfectly.
At the Bollywood Hungama actors roundtable, Manoj spoke about the benefits of rehearsals and recalled an anecdote about Amitabh Bachchan. â€œAmit ji rehearses quite diligently. Iâ€™ve done three or four films with him. You cannot mess with his cues. A couple of times, I improvised slightly. He says, â€˜Suniye, aapne kuch badla hai kya (Listen, have you changed something)?â€™ I said, â€˜Pata nahi sir (I donâ€™t know)â€™.â€

"Marvel had more riding on Jonathan Majors than perhaps any other actor. Now itâ€™s parting ways with him, and throwing years of plans for its cinematic universe in disarray.
Marvel Studios and the Walt Disney Co. dropped Majors from all future projects following the actorâ€™s conviction for assault and harassment on Monday, according to a person close to the studio who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasnâ€™t authorized to speak publicly on the matter.
The swift move by Disney marked a stunning about-face for an actor who had been one of Hollywoodâ€™s fastest-rising stars. A Manhattan jury on Monday found the 34-year-old Majors guilty of one misdemeanor assault charge and one harassment violation for a March altercation with his then-girlfriend Grace Jabbari.
ADVERTISEMENT
Majors, who was acquitted of a different assault charge and of aggravated harassment, will be sentenced on Feb 6. He declined to comment as he left the courthouse. Majorsâ€™ attorney, Priya Chaudhry, said in a statement that â€œit is clear that the jury did not believe Grace Jabbariâ€™s story of what happened in the SUV because they found that Mr Majors did not intentionally cause any injuries to her.â€
â€œMr Majors still has faith in the process and looks forward to fully clearing his name,â€ said Chaudhry.
As the superhero studio prepared phase five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it cast the highly acclaimed Majors as the antagonist Kang the Conqueror. The character was to span several films and series as the Marvel Cinematic Universeâ€™s next-phase answer to Thanos, the villain of Avengers: Endgame.
Majors had already appeared in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and the first two seasons of Loki. He was to star in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, dated for release in May 2026.
ADVERTISEMENT
The future of The Kang Dynasty is now unclear. Disney declined to comment on whether it will recast the role of Kang or pivot in a new direction.
Also read | Assault trial for actor Jonathan Majors postponed until September
The studio has been preparing for the possibility of Majorsâ€™ exit from the franchise. But Marvel was limited in its ability to fashion rewrites due to the screenwriters strike that ran from May to late September. The studio recently hired screenwriter Michael Waldron to rework The Kang Dynasty.
For Marvel, Majorsâ€™ departure adds to a series of recent setbacks. Though its box-office success â€” nearly $30 billion worldwide from 33 films â€” is unsurpassed in movie history, the superhero factory has recently seen some atypical struggles. The Marvels, released in November, has been the MCUâ€™s worst performer in theaters, with $204 million in worldwide ticket sales.
Majors also recently starred as a troubled amateur bodybuilder in Magazine Dreams, which made an acclaimed debut at the Sundance Film Festival in January and was acquired by the Disney-owned indie distributor Searchlight Pictures. Following its premiere, an Oscar nomination for Majors was widely predicted.
ADVERTISEMENT
Magazine Dreams had been dated to open in theaters in Dec 8. But ahead of Majorsâ€™ trial, Searchlight removed the film from its release calendar. Instead, on Dec 8 text messages from Majors were read in the fifth day of the trial. In one, Majors begged Jabbari not to seek medical attention for a head injury sustained in 2022, warning she had â€œno perspective of what could happenâ€ if the truth got out.
In late February as Creed III, starring Majors alongside Michael B Jordan, was being released, Majors spoke in an interview with The Associated Press in the neighborhood of Chelsea, just a few blocks away from where his fight with Jabbari would weeks later spill out onto New York streets.
Majors then sounded acutely aware that his rapid new fame carried the risk of a downfall.
â€œThough Iâ€™ve not seen the boogeyman, I know itâ€™s out there,â€ Majors said. â€œAnd Iâ€™ve been around to know itâ€™s cominâ€™. I wonâ€™t go down my rabbit hole of death, but itâ€™s cominâ€™. But you outrun it. You just stay out of the frame. Iâ€™ll stay out of the frame.â€

"Prashanth Neelâ€™s Prabhas-starrer Salaar Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire is all set for a face-off with Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Dunki, in a manner unprecedented in the realm of Indian cinema. Unlike Dunki, a comedy-drama, Salaar is an epic action thriller.
Since the release of the Prabhas filmâ€™s trailer on December 1, debates have been rife regarding the alleged glorification of on-screen violence in the film â€” a trend some associate with the surge in â€œpan-Indian filmsâ€ like Neelâ€™s KGF series. While some view it as a source of adrenaline or aligning with the respective filmâ€™s narrative, others consider it an alarming trend with potential societal repercussions.

"Actor Siddhant Karnick, who played a supporting role in the Ranbir Kapoor-starrer blockbuster film Animal, said that each actor got a share of the attention after the filmâ€™s success. He was responding to chatter online that Rashmika Mandanna, the female lead of the film, was overshadowed by Triptii Dimri, who appeared in a smaller role but walked away with a lot of attention.
He said in an interview with Siddharth Kannan that he didnâ€™t feel this, and cited the example of Bobby Deol. â€œEveryone got their own importance. Maybe the intensity was different. For example, Bobby Deol came for 15 minutes, but heâ€™s the next big thing weâ€™re talking about right after Ranbir. The cousins, that pind family, what a beautiful set-upâ€¦ I donâ€™t think actors within the same project should be competing for popularity. Film does well, everybody does well.â€

"Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Animal is getting flak from the audience for glorifying violence and toxic masculinity, but some are in awe of the performance of its cast members, especially Ranbir Kapoor and Bobby Deol. The climax sequence of the film where the two actors are seen fighting each other while bare-chested has found a special mention. Recently, the actors who essayed the role of Ranbirâ€™s cousins in the film revealed how Ranbir and Bobby braved the cold weather of London during the shoot of the filmâ€™s climax.
In a recent interaction with Pinkvilla, actor Kamaljeet Rana shared details about the shoot of Animalâ€™s climax. He revealed that the scene was shot at an old London airport where aircraft are repaired. He said, â€œYou know about Londonâ€™s weather. It was so windy and cold. But we never saw Bobby or Ranbir say, â€˜It is very cold, letâ€™s wait for the temperature to change a bit.'â€

"Actor Siddhant Karnick, who played a supporting role in the blockbuster film Animal, said that many have criticised director Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s sensibilities, but few understand the struggles that he has gone through. Siddhant, who plays one of the several villainous characters in the massively successful film, narrated the setbacks that Vanga has experienced, and said that nobody can doubt his commitment to his craft.
In an interview with Siddharth Kannan, Karnick spoke about the many criticisms that have been leveled against Animal, and explained why the film isnâ€™t glorifying the bad behaviour of its protagonist, played by Ranbir Kapoor. But, he said, audiences should also be aware of Vangaâ€™s personal life story, and the sacrifices that his family made in order to empower him.

"Despite massive hate campaigns against the film from various quarters, Jeo Babyâ€™s Kaathal â€“ The Core, starring Mammootty and Jyotika in the lead roles, continues to thrive in theatres and remains a topic of discussion in many circles due to its plot revolving around homosexuality.
For Tamil actor Jyotika, who returned to the Malayalam industry after a 13-year hiatus, no other film could have provided a warmer reception, given the positive responses her performance in Kaathal garnered nationwide.

"Actor Bobby Deol, whose extended cameo in the blockbuster film Animal is being appreciated, spoke about not judging his villainous character, and how he nailed a shot in one take by harnessing personal emotions into his performance. In an interview with Film Companion, Bobby said that he simply imagined someone harming his brother, actor Sunny Deol, and the emotions flowed out of him.
The scene that he was referring to is the one in which his character, Abrar, is informed that his brother has been killed. This sends Abrar on a warpath with Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s Ranvijay, the protagonist of the movie. But because the film doesnâ€™t deal in black and white, Bobby said that in their final face-off, itâ€™s impossible to differentiate between the hero and the villain.

Kareena Kapoor Khan believes that if an actor is talented and can connect with viewers through their performance, â€˜stardom will followâ€™.

In a new interview, Kareena said that being a good actor and a big star goes â€˜hand in gloveâ€™. She told Film Companion, â€œIf you are great, talented, and people have liked you, connected with you, stardom will follow. It is not like, â€˜Oh he has got six-pack abs, he is looking so hot, he is a big star.â€™ Arree please yaar! Sometimes, I feel like telling those actors, â€˜Please wear your T-shirt first.

"The countdown is on for the high-octane box office clash between two of the most anticipated Indian films of 2023 â€” Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Dunki and Prashanth Neelâ€™s Prabhas-starrer Salaar Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire. With Dunki set to hit the screens on December 21 and Salaar landing a day later, tickets for both films are selling like hotcakes after advance bookings started recently.
However, the pre-release business figures reveal an unexpected trend where the comedy drama Dunki is outperforming the epic action-thriller Salaar in terms of Day 1 business. While Dunki, releasing only in Hindi, has already grossed Rs 7.39 crore by selling 2,52,207 tickets for 9,681 shows nationwide, Salaar has so far managed to eke out only Rs 6.01 crore across all languages, according to industry tracker Sacnilk. The film has sold 2,47,572 tickets for the 4,338 listed shows.

"After a good jump in collections on Sunday, filmmaker Meghna Gulzarâ€™s war drama biopic, Sam Bahadur, witnessed a fall on its third Monday. The Vicky Kaushal-starrer netted Rs 1.65 cr on its 18th day of release, according to industry tracker Sacnilk. The third Monday figures are still not the lowest that the film has put up, as it had netted a similar amount on its 14th day of release, which was last Thursday. The total collections of the film now stand at Rs 78.25 cr domestically, and over Rs 105 cr globally.

"Sometime in early December 2013: Mohanlal has had a challenging year so far. Except for Red Wine, which, despite receiving positive reviews, did not emerge as a big hit, all his other films â€” Lokpal, Ladies and Gentleman and Geethaanjali â€” were both panned and turned out to be commercial disappointments. This is in contrast to 2012 when he enjoyed three super hits â€” Grandmaster, Spirit and Run Baby Run.
Just as the year was coming to a close, the trailer of a movie helmed by Jeethu Joseph, known for Memories (2013), My Boss (2012) and Detective (2007), arrived. However, the trailer failed to generate significant anticipation as it appeared rather sombre. Set against a backdrop of somewhat cheerful music, it immediately revealed that Mohanlalâ€™s character in the film was not larger-than-life but a simple villager, reminiscent of his roles in Sathyan Anthikad movies. The majority of the promo showcased endearing moments between Mohanlalâ€™s character, his wife, two daughters and a couple of other characters. Even as the video approached its conclusion, it only conveyed that the film centred around a family encountering â€œa few hurdlesâ€, much like any other drama.

"Director Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Animal, starring Ranbir Kapoor and Rashmika Mandanna, is making the most of the time it has left before Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Dunki arrives in theatres this week. After entering the Rs 500 crore club domestically on Sunday, the film recorded its lowest-ever single-day haul on Monday. It earned Rs 5.50 crore on its 18th day, reported industry tracker Sacnilk.
The total domestic collection of Animal now stands at Rs 517.94 crore. The film needs only around Rs 8 crore to surpass Sunny Deolâ€™s Gadar 2 as the sixth highest-grossing Indian film in India. Gadar 2 ended its theatrical run with Rs 525.7 crore. But time is running out for Animal, with Dunki and Salaar around the corner. SRKâ€™s previous two releases, Jawan (Rs 640.25 cr) and Pathaan (Rs 543.09 cr) hold the fourth and fifth positions in the list of all-time highest-grossing Indian films.

"2023 was not great for Tamil cinema as even Vijay and Ajith struggled to secure a hit which impressed everyone across the board. The year did have some quality releases like Good Night, Dada, and Chittha, but it also had some disappointing films that balanced the scale. Many films listed here were among the much-awaited movies of the year, but ended up as damp squibs much to the dismay of fans.

"Even before pan-Indian cinema became a thing, Malayalam superstar Prithviraj Sukumaran was known for collaborating with talents across industries. After establishing himself as a promising actor in Malayalam, Prithviraj went on to play a menacing villain named Madhan in Kana Kanden. He is perhaps the very few actors who has won the state awards of both Tamil Nadu (for Kaaviya Thalaivan) and Kerala (Celluloid, Ayalum Njanum Thammil, and Vaasthavam). Prithviraj also made a mark in Bollywood and played it to the stereotype with the song Dreamum Wakeuppam in Aiyaaa. He has also been a part of the Telugu industry with the film Police Police.
With Salaar, directed by Prashanth Neel and starring Prabhas, Prithviraj has become a prominent figure in Tollywood. It is now safe to say that Prithviraj is pan-Indian cinema personified, and no wonder the star has been making a strong case for the amalgamation of all the film industries of India to become one big family. In this chat with indianexpress, he shares more about his take on the ongoing trend.

"For a long time, director Prashanth Neel and his team were finding it hard to find an actor for the antagonistâ€™s role in Salaar Part 1: Ceasefire. Prashanth, in a recent interview, revealed that he always wanted Prithviraj but wasnâ€™t sure whether the Malayalam star would come on board. But, Prithviraj loved the script and came on board readily and made some valuable creative suggestions that made Salaar what it is today, revealed the Salaar director.
When asked the reason behind casting Prithviraj in Salaar Part 1: Ceasefire, Prashanth told Galatta Plus, â€œWe needed an actor more than a star or anything else. We needed a phenomenal actor for the role of Varadharaja Mannar. The friendship that we wanted to showâ€¦ we wanted someone who could show both the love and the hate in him. For a long time, we were thinking about who should we bring in. A lot of suggestions said that we have to bring in someone from the Hindi film industry. One name that kept popping in my head and I thought was a big ask was Prithviraj. And we pursued him for some time. I thought he wouldnâ€™t agree after hearing the script.â€

On The Film Companion Actorsâ€™ Adda, Bobby said, â€œThere is so much that happens in your life. There are so many moments you have been hurt and the relationships you share with your family. When I was doing this film and when I was told the story, I didnâ€™t think I was a villain. I was told that I had a grandfather who committed suicide in front of me and it was such a big shock that I lost my voice. I kept that in my mind.â€

"Prashanth Neel has revealed why small moments in his films matter more than the big moments like the heroic scenes of KGF movies. The director also shared that it is easy to create mass moments and all the filmmakers have started to create good action blocks.
When asked if he would write certain scenes wondering how the audience is going to react to it, Prashanth told Galatta Plus, â€œI will give you an example. After KGF came out and it got a response, many people came and said that they liked the bun scene. It has nothing to do with scale or elevation. The way I see successful directors do it and I mimic them in making the small moments work more than the big ones. I think thatâ€™s what they (the audience) will take back. In Salaar as well we have put in a lot of those small moments without the big CGI work and punchlinesâ€¦ because thatâ€™s what I think is pan-Indian. We all get the fights right. All the movies that I have lovedâ€¦ the pan-Indian moviesâ€¦ I loved their small moments.â€

Kareena has now opened up about how the camera was really close to her face for a crucial scene in the film and said that, surprisingly, she didnâ€™t worry about her looks for the first time. The actor also commented on how the industry tends to stereotype female stars based on their appearance and spoke about her struggle of proving herself as an actor. 
On The Film Companionâ€™s Actorsâ€™ Adda, Kareena said, â€œThe industry kind off boxes you to constantly focus on the way you are looking. But I have always tried to break away from that fact. I want to be an actor first. This has been the case right from my first movie.â€

"â€œThe way you perceive freedom might not be the same as how I do. Sometimes, we might have to weed out certain obstacles in our path. Isnâ€™t that what freedom is?â€ observes CK Raghavan (Mammootty) in Venuâ€™s Munnariyippu (2014), before finally uprooting the one â€œannoyingâ€ obstacle in his path and returning to prison, where he truly experiences freedom. The situation is somewhat the same for Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore) in Frank Darabontâ€™s The Shawshank Redemption (1994). It is in prison that Brooks actually feels a sense of belonging after spending 50 years behind bars. Hence, the â€œimprisonmentâ€ in the outside world is horrifying for both.
On the other hand, for Geetha (Beena R Chandran) in Fazil Razakâ€™s Thadavu (The  Sentence), a myriad of things, including peace, happiness and money to treat a fatal health condition, are unattainable in the real world. Consequently, for all of them, life in the outside world is an unjust sentence they have been burdened with and thus they realise that prisons are where they can breathe with ease.

"In the current scenario, you either make a big-budget pan-Indian movie with stars from different film industries or you make a war film like Operation Valentine that plays to the gallery of patriotic Indians. The war movies have now gotten an upgrade as the drama is unfolding mid-air with fighter planes. We earlier saw it in the trailer of Hrithik Roshanâ€™s Fighter, and now, Varun Tej and Manushi Chhillar-starrer Operation Valentine seems like a lite version of the same air warfare.
Touted to be based on the biggest Indian airstrike in history, Operation Valentine is directed by Shakti Pratap Singh Hada. The film is produced by Sony Pictures and A Renaissance Pictures, who earlier backed another war film Major.

"While debates surrounding the Central Board of Film Certificationâ€™s (CBFC) purportedly unjust censorship of movies intensify, another, possibly the last, streaming platform has completely halted the streaming of uncensored versions of Indian films globally.
As per a report by The Hindu, which it claims to have created after a review of many films released this year, Netflix has now joined the ranks of OTT platforms that discontinued showing versions of Indian films before obtaining CBFC approval.

According to the report, Anubhav Sinhaâ€™s Bheed, Lokesh Kanagarajâ€™s Leo and Amit Raiâ€™s OMG 2 were among the movies that faced cuts at junctures depicting or addressing political, communal or adult themes.

While other streaming platforms have been following this practice for some time, with few exceptions for specific titles, Netflixâ€™s adoption of this approach effectively grants the CBFC indirect control over what Indians watch in films, even online.
ICYMI | Shah Rukh Khan calls Dunki his â€˜best filmâ€™, says he made it for himself: â€˜I made Jawan and Pathaan forâ€¦â€™
Although Netflix refrained from responding to queries about its changing censorship practices, the streaming service told The Hindu in a statement, â€œWe have an incredibly broad range of Indian original films and TV shows, all of which speak to our long-standing support for creative expression. This diversity not only reflects our membersâ€™ very different tastes, it also distinguishes our service from the competition.â€
Earlier this year, veteran actor Govind Namdev had condemned the A certificate that was given to OMG 2 by the CBFC. Govind, in a Facebook post, said that the movie had to undergo 24 cuts and eventually got a â€œsenseless A certificateâ€, thus, it could not be watched by teenagers who were the target audience of the film.

I started the year with Pathaan, which was always ladies first, and I want to end the year with a film for myself. So, please watch Dunki on December 21.

"There wasnâ€™t a dry eye in the house as writer-director Aamir Bashir walked towards the stage following the Dharamshala International Film Festival screening of his new film, Maagh â€“ The Winter Within. A modern-day fable about Kashmir, Maagh played to stunned silence for over an hour-and-a-half, before earning a most well-deserved standing ovation. Bashir, who previously directed the under-seen Harud (Autumn) more than a decade ago, spoke soberly about the never-ending winter that his home has been shrouded under. After answering a few questions, he took his leave, dismissing the moderatorâ€™s optimistic suggestion that his trilogy would remain incomplete without the obvious next instalment. He joked mirthlessly that he already has a title for his third film: Our Spring Will Never Come.
Soulful, stirring, and simmering with scorched-earth rage, The Winter Within is the best Indian film of the year, a stifled scream of a movie that is as breathtaking to behold as it is heart-wrenching to watch. It tells the story of a young woman named Nargis (a magnetic Zoya Hussain), who works as a house help in Srinagar and reports like clockwork at a local detention centre where she suspects her missing husband, Manzoor (Manzoor Ahmad Bhat), has been kept under suspicion of being a militant. Nargis is among the thousands of â€˜half-widowsâ€™ of Kashmir, women who donâ€™t know if their husbands are alive or not, cursed to spend their lives in an emotional limbo.

She makes ends meet by weaving shawls that she sells to a local businessman named Yaseen (Shabir Ahmad Lone) who secretly harbours feelings for her, but maintains a respectful distance. But when Nargis attracts unexpected attention for her determined quest to locate Manzoor, she is fired from her job and forced to return to her village home. There, as a member of a nomad community, she is further marginalised by her own. Bashirâ€™s film calls into question the many atrocities that have been inflicted upon his people, but he doesnâ€™t hesitate to offer internal critique about the corruption of the complacent and the the apathy of the elite.
A still from The Winter Within.
The early scenes are marked by a quiet oppression and the illusion of peace. Everyday realities are captured remarkably by co-writer and cinematographer Shanker Ramanâ€™s composed, Kiarostami-esque camera, which hovers with equal ease over the hills and valleys of Kashmirâ€™s landscape and the expressive faces of its people. The paranoia, on the other hand, is built through stray shots of commandos, armed trucks passing in the background, and the sound of radio chatter. Music is used sparingly; the filmâ€™s searing emotion is conveyed mostly through a series of close-ups that are confrontational by design. In these 90 minutes, you will not be allowed to avert your eyes from this tragedy; you thought you were free, but complicity, the movie says, is its own form of capture.
Shortly after Nargisâ€™ return to her village, and mere hours after Yaseen has made his feelings known, Manzoor shows up out of the blue, adding a new layer of complexity to her life. Clearly traumatised by his imprisonment, he is unable to eat or sleep. Instead, he spends his days and nights smoking endlessly near the window, framed in stunning tableaus once again designed to draw your attention to the horrors hidden beneath the beauty of this land. Bashir satirises how outsiders view the Valley in a shocking sequence towards the end, when Manzoor tries to rehabilitate himself by finding work in the tourism industry. Oh, the irony. Itâ€™s like the displaced Tibetan community in India having to sell Chinese food in order to make ends meet. Manzoor tugs entitled young couples across the snow, the rope wrapped around his neck like a noose. He is a mule. He is a servant. He is a dead man walking. The tourists â€” these are the kind of people who probably watched The Kashmir Files in theatres â€” scream at him to hurry up, to pull harder. They abused him when he chose violence, and they abuse him now, after his spirit and body have been systematically destroyed.
A still from The Winter Within.
But thereâ€™s hope yet for Nargis, or, at least thatâ€™s what we try to convince ourselves into believing. She represents both the harsh realities and poetic ideals of Kashmir. As the wife of a militant, her reputation has forever been stained. But she didnâ€™t pick up arms like her husband, despite her desire for â€˜azaadiâ€™; she chose to preserve her identity through her art. Through the course of the film, Nargis crafts the most intricate shawl â€” her magnum opus; an ode to the resilience of an entire community, and a symbol of her silent protest. In many ways, Nargis is Bashir â€” a custodian of her culture, and a chronicler of its pain.

You become so familiar with the contours of her face over 90 minutes, it begins to have an oddly comforting affect. Which is why the final shot â€” one of the most haunting images in recent memory â€” will linger forever in my mind. Almost as an act of defiance, the camera detaches itself from its tripod and begins scanning the surroundings for some stability. It is as if the movie is finally shedding its own delusions. Hope is a pipe dream for some, regardless of whether theyâ€™re living in conflict zones or making films in an industry that actively seems to be averse to empathy. Those predisposed to bigotry will not be converted by this filmâ€™s beauty; it would be irrational to think otherwise, especially in an era where sensitivity is seen as something to snark at and â€˜contentâ€™ is greenlit on the basis of whether it could make a good thumbnail or not. But by merely existing, The Winter Within can thaw the coldest hearts.

â€œShah Rukh sir was such a nice person to talk to, very humble. He knew that all of us were new, so were scared and he had experience. An actor gets an actor. To work with him was an amazing experience, I have never worked with a co-star like him. When I had to shoot our first scene together, I was so nervous, my heart was pounding.

"Actor Sunny Deol believes his recent release Gadar 2 has helped him establish a connection with the younger audiences, who have now started exploring his past filmography.
The Anil Sharma-directorial, which hit the screens in August, turned out to be a surprise hit of the year with over Rs 500 crore in worldwide gross box office collection, much like its predecessor Gadar: Ek Prem Katha, which was the highest grossing Hindi movie of 2001.
â€œWith â€˜Gadar 2â€², what happened is all my fans and all the people that wanted to see the kind of cinema which they had seen in â€˜Gadarâ€™â€¦ We kept the story that way and people came to see the character, which is deep rooted in their hearts. â€œBut the beauty of it was the new generation that has got connected to me. I was not connected to them otherwise. They got to see what Iâ€™m doing (in â€˜Gadar 2â€™) and are now seeing some of my older films,â€ Deol told PTI in an interview here.
ADVERTISEMENT
The 66-year-old actor reprised his role of Tara Singh in Gadar 2, set years after the events of the first movie. It saw Tara Singh return to Pakistan in order to rescue his imprisoned son Charanjeet â€œJeeteâ€ Singh (played by Utkarsh Sharma) during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971.
When Gadar 2 came out, Deol said, he visited some theatres and was bowled over by the response. â€œI could see the love and appreciation. It all felt good. Iâ€™m thankful for the love and trust in me. From now on, Iâ€™ll keep doing movies that people will love,â€ he added.
Prior to the filmâ€™s release, Deol said the sentiment among the industry folks and critics was that the movie will not work at the ticket window. â€œWe would not know about the sentiment of the audience, we would know about the sentiment of the industry. Yahan industry ka sentiment itna woh nahi tha (The sentiment in the industry was not positive), they were making predictions, the critics and even others bashed the film,â€ he said.
Also read | Sunny Deolâ€™s on his viral drunk video: â€˜If I want to drink, would I do it on the road and in an auto rickshaw?â€™
But the audience is open to all kinds of movies, whether it is his movie, his younger brother Bobby Deolâ€™s Animal or Rocky aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, which featured his father Dharmendra in a pivotal role.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œWe make films for the audience. Our films are made for all kinds of audiences. Like, thereâ€™s â€˜Animalâ€™ and â€˜Rocky Raniâ€™. Audience is accepting all kinds of films. If the critics want to critique a film, then they should write a thesis on art movies, this cinema is not for that.â€
â€œIt is high time that we all be nice and happy that this year has been so good for us and the audience is going back to theatres. We are today offering films that they want to see. It is a good time for Hindi cinema and I believe this will continue.â€ As the eldest son of cinema icon Dharmendra, Deol started his cinema journey in 1983 with Betaab and enjoyed a great run in the initial years with hits such as Arjun, Ghayal, Damini, Ghatak, Border, Arjun Pandit and Gadar, among others. Post Gadar, he went through a dry patch which took him 20 years to overcome.
What kept Deol going all these years is his sportsman spirit and a positive frame of mind. â€œYou have to walk a path. No matter how much you talk about it, argue or (do) self-pity, you still have to walk. Why waste your energy? â€œIâ€™m a sports guy. You win or you lose, you learn and you move ahead. Sports guys have a positive adrenaline and thatâ€™s what I have in me. Iâ€™m one of those guys who gets up before the sun rises and goes to sleep (early). I love the days, I canâ€™t take the nights,â€ he said.
Asked whether he learned anything during the rough patch in his career, the actor said a person grows every day. â€œThatâ€™s how you keep moving, rather than sitting and thinking about it because what has to happen will happen. If it (success of â€˜Gadar 2â€²) hadnâ€™t happened, I would still be working like this only and would be trying to do something or the other. I would not be grumbling and criticising,â€ he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The actor revealed he is working on a number of projects, including the sequel to his 2007 movie Apne. The follow-up will also feature his father Dharmendra, brother Bobby and son Karan Deol.
Besides, he will also star in Baap with Sanjay Dutt, Jackie Shroff and Mithun Chakraborty, and Lahore, 1947, which will be produced by superstar Aamir Khan.
â€œThere were a lot of proposals coming and it is very difficult to work with all of them. You canâ€™t do everything. There are a couple of films that Iâ€™m doing and they will be announced when they are ready to be announced. Thereâ€™s a lot to do. I havenâ€™t done much in the last so many years,â€ Deol said.
â€œSince â€˜Gadar 2â€², Iâ€™ve been doing a lot of films. Thereâ€™s â€˜Lahoreâ€™ and talks are on for â€˜Border 2â€²,â€ he added. When asked if he will be collaborating with any contemporary filmmaker, the actor said directors of his era are still masters when it comes to presenting society and the nationâ€™s rich history.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œI somehow feel that directors with whom Iâ€™ve worked have more of a sense of society, emotions, values, country and our history. And that was reflected in our films, and that connected with people as well. Today, things are being made, they are nice and interesting but we are lacking in depth.â€ Deol, who turned director for films like Dillagi (1999), Ghayal Once Again (2016) and 2019â€™s Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas, which marked his son Karanâ€™s debut, has no plans to direct a movie.
â€œIâ€™m not going to be on the other side anymore. I just want to be an actor. As an actor, Iâ€™ve taken myself away from everything,â€ he said.

"Filmmaker Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s film Animal is making headlines for its box-office success but the film has also generated some controversy for glorifying violence and misogyny. Siddhant Karnick, who plays Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s brother-in-law in the film, has now discussed a particular scene where Ranbirâ€™s character, Ranvijay, pulls on Rashmika Mandannaâ€™s characterâ€™s bra strap, leaving her in pain. 
In an interview with Bollywood Now, Siddhant was asked about his reaction to the scene as an audience member and the actor said that the audience shouldnâ€™t judge them. He also implied that Rashmikaâ€™s character might have consented to this, even though the film doesnâ€™t really say that. He said, â€œI understood the kinkiness Ranbirâ€™s character was trying to show with the bra strap. See there are terms called masochism and sadism, which are used in sexual orientation. That showed that Rashmikaâ€™s character could be a masochist. She was agreeable to that kind of act.â€

Prior to the filmâ€™s release on December 22, one day after its major competitor Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Dunki hits the screens, Prithviraj opened up about the film and asserted that Salaar surpasses the scale of Neelâ€™s Yash-starrer KGF 2.
Addressing the comparisons made between the films, the Malayalam actor told News18, â€œI understand the comparisons that are happening between Salaar and KGF 2. I am a big Prashant Neel fan and I would have been disappointed had I seen his next film after KGF 2, which opens in a tulip field in Amsterdam. It is not something that I expect from him. It is too premature for the audience because 10 minutes into Salaar people will forget all the comparisons.â€"

Mentioning that Balachander was ahead of his time, Prakash Raj underscored that he selected actors based on their talent rather than their caste or creed. â€œHe found actors not based on caste or creed, but because he just wanted them to tell his stories. There was a very fair play there,â€ the veteran actor said during a chat with Film Companion South.
â€œDuring his time, there was Ilaiyaraaja, and then suddenly I saw AR Rahman and Mani Ratnam coming, who have a very different way of making films. I was very lucky to blend and have them fine-tune me. Mani would appreciate Balachander, but he would not want that (KB) school of acting. I think my success is immediately realising and adapting to it,â€ he added.

"The 28th edition of the International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK) concluded with a vibrant ceremony at the Nishagandhi Auditorium in Kanakakunnu Palace, Thiruvananthapuram, on Friday, with actor Prakash Raj as the chief guest.
However, similar to the 27th editionâ€™s closing ceremony, Kerala State Chalachithra Academy chairman, Ranjith, was booed by the audiences when he stood up to address the gathering. While everyone else, including Prakash Raj, received enthusiastic applause, Ranjith alone faced this negative reaction from the public, although he chose not to address it in his speech.

Meanwhile, the KSCA chairman invited the Academy staff onto the stage. These staff members had worked tirelessly to ensure the smooth execution of the film festival. This move prompted the viewers to stop booing Ranjith, allowing the workers to join the stage without facing embarrassment.

Last year, Ranjith came under intense scrutiny when some attendees were arrested for protesting at the IFFK after they were denied seats for Lijo Jose Pellisseryâ€™s Mammootty-starrer Nanpakal Nerathu Mayakkam, despite having reservations and waiting in line for hours. During the closing ceremony, when the audiences expressed disapproval, Ranjith compared them to street dogs, intensifying the controversy.
Express at IFFK | Paradise movie review: Darshana Rajendran, Roshan Mathew film is a masterclass in filmmaking
While discontent has lingered since Ranjith assumed the role of KSCA chairman in January last year, it reached unprecedented levels this year. Even members of the Academy openly expressed dissatisfaction with Ranjithâ€™s conduct on several occasions. On December 14, a day before the festivalâ€™s conclusion, a group of nine members of the Academyâ€™s general council held a meeting, and sent a letter to the state government, demanding Ranjithâ€™s removal as KSCA chairman.
In the complaint, the nine members accused Ranjith of disregarding their opinions and described his decisions as arbitrary, Manorama Online reported. The nine members openly rebelling against the chairman are Manoj Kana, Cuckoo Parameswaran, N Arun, Mummy Centuary, Prakash Sreedhar, Shaibu Mundakkal, A S Jobu, Siby and Santhosh, according to the media house.
Speaking to Reporter TV, director Manoj Kana said that many of Ranjithâ€™s recent remarks about his colleagues were in poor taste. Pointing out that each general council member has specific duties, Kana recalled that when Cuckoo Parameswaran recently approached Ranjith with a complaint, he dismissed her concerns, stating that â€œher services were no longer needed at the IFFKâ€. Stressing that Ranjithâ€™s authoritative behaviour and arrogance were hindering their ability to work with him, Kana mentioned that they have submitted written complaints to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Culture and Youth Affairs Minister Saji Cherian and the Chalachithra Academy. Kana added, â€œIn the formal complaint, weâ€™ve insisted on either his self-correction or his removal from the position. Our stance is not against either the government or KSCA. Our objective is to prevent any negative impact on the reputation of both entities.â€
ADVERTISEMENT
Speaking to reporters earlier in the day, Kana emphasised that their objection was solely directed at Ranjithâ€™s elitist and autocratic behaviour. He stated, â€œRanjith is disparaging everyone through interviews. This is not the Varikkasseri Mana location; this is the Chalachithra Academy.â€
Express at IFFK | Family movie review: Don Palatharaâ€™s stellar film exposes how family, religious institutions and society create a safe space for predators
The controversy this year sparked when Ranjith, in an interview with The New Indian Express, made critical comments about renowned filmmaker Dr Biju, questioning the latterâ€™s â€œrelevanceâ€ based on the limited audience turnout for his recent release, Adrishya Jalakangal, which was also screened in the Kaleidoscope category of the recently concluded IFFK.
Meanwhile, following a strong critique of Ranjith, Dr Biju resigned from his position as a board member of the Kerala State Film Development Corporation (KSFDC). In the same TNIE interview, Ranjith also made controversial comments about actor Bheeman Reghu and criticised many others and their films, including Mohanlal and his dialogue delivery in P Padmarajanâ€™s Thoovanathumbikal (1987).
However, amid all the controversies, Ranjith dismissed any discord on Friday, stating that everything is in order at the Academy. â€œEverything whatâ€™s been heard is the creation of the media. There has been no meeting at all, and those who are out in the open are only a few, as three of them whom they named have told me they did not take part in any meeting. There is no question of me resigning as there exists no such issue. If at all it happens, you (the media) will be the first to be told,â€ IANS quoted Ranjith as saying.

As both the Chief Minister and the Culture Minister are currently engaged in the governmentâ€™s ongoing Nava Kerala Sadas program, an official response to the controversy is still pending. With the programme set to conclude in less than 10 days, a final decision on the matter is anticipated soon.
A screenwriter-turned-filmmaker, Ranjith has faced substantial criticism over the years for his films, which are often scrutinised for promoting elitism, misogyny and casteism within savarna narratives. He is widely recognised as an artist who has played a role in popularising regressive ideologies through Malayalam cinema.
Previously, popular filmmaker Vinayan had also levelled serious allegations against Ranjith, accusing him of influencing the Kerala State Film Award committee. In a series of Facebook posts, Vinayan alleged that Ranjith misused his power as Chalachitra Academy chairman and tried to prevent his latest movie Pathonpatham Noottandu from receiving major awards."
"Actor Shreyas Talpade is recovering from a heart attack. In a recent interview, he had spoken about how a regular income is a far-fetched dream for most actors in the film industry.
Shreyas made a mark on the audience with his starring performance in the 2005 film Iqbal, and since then, he has been part of several hit films. In an interview with Bollywood Bubble, he shared how his mother always advised him to take up a salaried job. Shreyas said, â€œToday, you have different avenues of earning revenue. And it is only for this reason that for the longest time, till the day of Iqbalâ€™s release, my mom continuously kept telling me, â€˜Why donâ€™t you look for a steady, constant job that will give you a paycheque at the end of every month? Now you are married, how will you feed your wife?â€™.â€

"Filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj said that Aamir Khan was interested in playing Langda Tyagi in the 2006 film Omkara, and he made his feelings known while they were working together on a separate project that didnâ€™t materialise. He also revealed that Saif Ali Khan was chosen to play the role because he was willing to put in the hard work, but was reluctant to cut his hair.
Talking about casting Saif Ali Khan as Langda Tyagi in Omkara, the filmmaker said in an interview with mid-day, â€œFor Saif, I think, Aamir is responsible for that.â€ When asked how, he responded by saying, â€œWe were doing that film together, so I spent a lot of time with Aamir. He is lovely company, and itâ€™s fun to hang around with him. Aamir would share what he had in his mind and ask me what I had in my mind to plan for the future. So, I told him that I have this Othello, and this Langda Tyagi character with me.â€

Vishal shared that the Dangal star was fascinated by Langda Tyagiâ€™s character. â€œHe told me, â€˜Whenever you make this film, Iâ€™d love to be considered for Langda Tyagi.â€™ So that remained with me, but the film didnâ€™t happen, I wasnâ€™t working for one and a half years. I wanted to make a film desperately, so I thought if this character can excite Aamir so much, then I can excite some another star with this. At the time, I had seen Saifâ€™s work.â€
Asked why Omkara didnâ€™t happen with Aamir, Vishal revealed, â€œHe was busy, he did Rang De Basanti, and I didnâ€™t want to get stuck for another one and a half years. I wanted to (make the film), with whoever I get.â€
When I saw Saif in Dil Chahta Hai, what Saif was before that, his voice was a little feminine, his performance would be ajeeb (weird). But in Dil Chahta Hai, he really worked on himself. In Dil Chahta Hai, he was a different Saif. I felt that he had a fire in him and had transformed himself. And he had shot up,â€ he added.
Vishal shared that when he pitched the film to Saif, he asked the actor, â€œAre you ready to work hard? Because nobody would be able to imagine that you can do that role. Nobody could imagine.â€ He continud, â€œBut he was ready to do that. He really (worked hard), except cutting his hair. With great effort, we convinced him to cut his hair because he was not ready to cut it. Other than that he was more than I asked for.â€

Omkara also starred Ajay Devgn, Kareena Kapoor and Vivek Oberoi. It was the second installment in the filmmakerâ€™s Shakespeare trilogy, which also includes Maqbool and Haidar.

"Filmmaker Vishal Bhardwajâ€™s 2003 drama, Maqbool, is seen as a modern masterpiece of Hindi cinema, but the director had to experience several setbacks to ensure that the film gets made. In a recent conversation, he revealed that he hasnâ€™t made any money from Maqbool, and that he nearly quit the film just two weeks before the shoot was scheduled to begin.
In an interview with mid-day, Vishal said that he had to give up his fees for directing, writing, editing and composing music for the film, all to get a location that he had his eye on. The filmmaker shared that he had a specific haveli in mind to recreate an old-world charm for the film. However, the filmâ€™s co-producer Bobby Bedi informed him just 15 days before the filmâ€™s shoot that he didnâ€™t have the budget to fly the entire unit to Bhopal from Mumbai.

"Actor Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s blockbuster film Animal, directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, is targeting the Rs 500 crore mark at the domestic box office this weekend. The film reached a total of Rs 484.34 crore on Friday, its 15th day of release. Animal has been on an indestructible path at the box office amid criticism for its treatment of women and glorification of toxic masculinity.
According to trade website Sacnilk, early estimates suggest that on its 15th day of release, Animal earned Rs 7.5 crore at the Indian box office. However, if the standalone performance is to be gauged, Friday marked the filmâ€™s lowest single-day haul. Animal has made Rs 784.45 crore worldwide in the first two weeks of its release, and should be able to pass the Rs 800 crore mark this weekend. Animal will also become the third Bollywood film of the year, behind Pathaan and Jawan, to gross more than $100 million globally.
This weekend is perhaps the last clear run that director Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s film has left, considering Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Dunki will be released on December 21, followed by Prabhasâ€™s Salaar just the next day. Dunki and Salaar are heavyweight films and will take up shows in Hindi and South language belts. Animal is currently the third-biggest Indian film of the year, and will soon pass Pathaan at the domestic box office. It is also Ranbirâ€™s biggest-ever film, and the biggest A-rated movie of all time.

Animal clashed with Vicky Kaushalâ€™s Sam Bahadur on December 1. But despite its obvious box office success, Animal invited massive criticism from several critics for its misogynist and violent content. Vangaâ€™s film also stars Anil Kapoor, Rashmika Mandanna and Bobby Deol in pivotal roles, and revolves around an emotionally imbalanced relationship between a father and son.

"When I started thinking of the worst films of the year, Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Animal won hands down. There were several turkeys in 2023, but nothing can beat this ugly, misogynistic paean to the Alpha male who thinks nothing of demeaning the women around him â€“ mothers, sisters, wives, lovers â€“ just to prove his â€˜mardaangiâ€™. Scratch that, not even demeaning, itâ€™s debasing. It is a film which may well turn out to be the biggest blockbuster of the year. It has given Ranbir Kapoor an unimaginable career boost. The other stars, especially Bobby Deol, Rashmika Mandanna and Tripti Dimri, will all get a leg-up on that tricky ladder which combines remuneration and recognition. But the film will be a blot on their CVs.
The only other one that can conceivably come close is Adipurush, which was supposed to be a worshipful tribute to the Maryada Purushottam. But this Om Raut monstrosity, starring Prabhas, Saif Ali Khan and Kriti Sanon, was dead on arrival: you can hide behind synonyms â€” Ram is Raghav, Sita is Janaki, Ravan is Lankeshâ€“ but thereâ€™s no running away from the fact that it was a confused, crass mash-up of Harry Potter and Lord Of The Rings and Game Of Thrones, minus any signs of reverence and piety.
Adipurush stars Prabhas as Raghav (Ram), Kriti Sanon as Janaki (Sita) and Saif Ali Khan as Lankesh (Raavan).
If you want a cringe-fest, just listen to its dialogues again. There are so many awful ones that I didnâ€™t know which to pick. But, okay, here goes: â€˜Kapda tere baap ka, tel tere baap ka, aag bhi tere baap ki, toh jalegi bhi tere baap ki.â€™ Ram ram.

And how can I forget The Kerala Story which claimed that it was doing a noble thing by uncovering the dastardly plans of spiriting away innocent Hindu and Christian young women from Kerala and converting them to Islam. Director Sudipto Sen and creative producer Vipul Amrutlal Shah claimed that their film was based on truth, telling the story of 32,000 young women who were held captive in ISIS camps on the Syria-Turkey border: it turned out that the number was 3, but the filmmakers did not think that there was a difference between the two numbers.
A still of Adah Sharma from The Kerala Story movie.
It doesnâ€™t just have a communal slant; the film peddles disinformation disingenuously, simply to increase polarisation in an already fractured polity. Itâ€™s also a badly-made, badly-acted film.
After breezing in to help Pathaan, Salman Khan went off to play in his own franchise. And showed up in Tiger 3, only to have wifey Katrina Kaif nearly dropping a towel and winning a deadly duel, neatly eclipsing the one and only Bhai. Is I-Spy is the only game left for this Khan? It would appear that thereâ€™s nothing else we want to see him do. Even his most ardent fans deserted him in the godawful Kisi Ka Bhai, Kisi Ki Jaan, in which Bhaijaan plays yet another version of himself in a plot which can not get over its delight of having him in the first place. Who cares, in fact, if thereâ€™s zero plot?

The last spot on this list is a toss-up between Tejas, and Ganapath. The first is Kangana Ranautâ€™s attempt at being a patriot and a fighter-pilot, in which she isnâ€™t as terrible as the movie, but cannot save it from crash-landing. The kindest thing I can say about â€˜Ganapathâ€™, starring Tiger Shroff, Kriti Sanon and Amitabh Bachchan, is that it should have stayed as an idea.

"Matthew Perry died from the acute effects of the anesthetic ketamine, according to the results of an autopsy on the 54-year-old â€œFriendsâ€ actor released Friday. The Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner said in the autopsy report that Perry also drowned in â€œthe heated end of his pool,â€ but that it was a secondary factor in his Oct. 28 death, deemed an accident.People close to Perry told investigators that he was undergoing ketamine infusion therapy, an experimental treatment used to treat depression and anxiety.
But the medical examiner said the levels of ketamine in Perryâ€™s body were in the range used for general anesthesia during surgery, and that his last treatment 1 1/2 weeks earlier wouldnâ€™t explain those levels. The drug is typically metabolized in a matter of hours.
The report says coronary artery disease and buprenorphine, which is used to treat opioid use disorder, also contributed.The amount of ketamine detected â€œwould be enough to make him lose consciousness and lose his posture and his ability to keep himself above the water,â€ said Dr. Andrew Stolbach, a medical toxicologist with Johns Hopkins Medicine who reviewed the autopsy report at the request of The Associated Press.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œUsing sedative drugs in a pool or hot tub, especially when youâ€™re alone, is extremely risky and, sadly, here itâ€™s fatal,â€ said Stolbach, who noted that both ketamine and buprenorphine can be used safely.Perry was declared dead after being found unresponsive at his home in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles. Investigators performed the autopsy the following day. The actor had taken drugs in the past but had been â€œreportedly clean for 19 months,â€ according to the report.
Perry had played pickleball earlier in the day, the report says, and his assistant, who lives with him, found him face down in the pool after returning from errands. The assistant told investigators Perry had not been sick, had not made any health complaints, and had not shown evidence of recent alcohol or drug use.Postmortem blood tests showed â€œhigh levelsâ€ of ketamine in his system, which could have raised his blood pressure and heart rate and dulled his impulse to breathe. Buprenorphine, commonly used in opioid addiction and found in therapeutic levels in Perryâ€™s blood, could have contributed to the breathing problem, the autopsy said. It would have been risky to mix the central nervous system depressant with ketamine â€œdue to the additive respiratory effects when present with high levels of ketamine,â€ according to the autopsy report. The report said his coronary artery disease would have made him more susceptible to the drugsâ€™ effects.
Perry was among the biggest television stars of his generation when he played Chandler Bing alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004 on NBCâ€™s megahit sitcom â€œFriends.â€His castmates, like many of his friends, family and fans, were stunned by his death, and paid him loving tribute in the weeks that followed. Perry was open about discussing his struggles with addiction dating back to his time on â€œFriends.â€
â€œI loved everything about the show but I was struggling with my addictions which only added to my sense of shame,â€ he wrote in his 2022 memoir. â€œI had a secret and no one could know.â€ A woman whose name is redacted in the autopsy report told investigators that Perry had been in good spirits when she spoke to him a few days earlier, but had been taking testosterone shots which she said were making him â€œangry and mean.â€ She said he had quit smoking two weeks earlier.The woman said he had been receiving the ketamine infusions for his mental health, and that his doctor had been giving them to him less often because he had been feeling well.Ketamine is a powerful anesthetic approved by U.S. health regulators for use during surgery, but in the past decade it has emerged as an experimental treatment for a range of psychiatric and hard-to-treat conditions, including depression, anxiety and chronic pain.While not approved by regulators, doctors are free to prescribe drugs for these alternate uses if they think their patients could benefit, and hundreds of clinics across the U.S. offer ketamine infusions and other formulations for various health conditions."
"Filmmaker Sujoy Ghosh has opened up about how veteran actor Amitabh Bachchan was â€˜nervousâ€™ on the first day of a filmâ€™s shoot. Sujoy revealed that Amitabh was murmuring to himself and did not realise that his mic was on. The filmmaker also revealed how Vidya Balan starrer Kahaani was his biggest risk and said that nobody gave him money for the film.
On Netflixâ€™s The Directorâ€™s Roundtable, Sujoy said, â€œFirst days of shoot are the most scariest days and you have no clue what your doing and we used to shi*t bricks right. One day we were shooting and it was the first day of the film and sir was on set and he was giving his first shot and his mic was on. And Amitji was murmuring to himself, â€˜Yar yeh pehla din hai, kitna saal hogaya abhi bhi mujhe itna nervous lagta hai (Itâ€™s the first day, and even after so many years, I still feel so nervous).â€™ So we realised we are not the only one.â€ 
Sujoy and Amitabh Bachchan have collaborated on films like Badla, Aladin and Te3n.

When asked about taking risks, Sujoy Ghosh said, â€œI think the biggest thing for me was Kahaani. Everybody kind off dissuaded me at that time. â€˜Pregnant woman running away in Calcutta? What were you thinking?â€™ And I think that probably was the biggest step of my career, especially coming out of two mega flops and embarking to such an extent that nobody believed in the film. Nobody gave me money to make the film. But that was good. Thatâ€™s the biggest risk I ever took.â€
Sujoy recently helmed the film Jaane Jaan. The film stars Kareena Kapoor Khan, Vijay Varma and Jaideep Ahlawat in the lead roles.

"Actor Prakash Raj, who has been actively working in Indian cinema for the last forty years, feels there is no particular code that aspiring actors can crack to become successful in their careers. As per the senior actor, there is â€˜no fair playâ€™ in cinema, and people like him are monopolising the industry as they also need to â€˜surviveâ€™.
When Film Companion asked Prakash the code that upcoming actors can use for a successful career, he replied, â€œNobody has an answer for that because there is no fair play. One is you think you are worthy enough to be in cinema, (you) may not be, (but) who will tell us that? Or, somebody sees you are worthy enough and chisels you, moulds you to it. Also, to be an actor, you need to decide where do you want to be, only in cinema, or you want to express or become popular like others, what is your agenda?â€

"In mid-2022, when Sri Lanka was engulfed in massive protests due to mounting discontent against the then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the government over mismanagement, resulting in a significant economic crisis, a Malayali couple arrives at the economically shattered country for a â€œcost-effective pleasure tripâ€.

For the couple, Kesav (Roshan Mathew) and Amritha (Darshana Rajendran), who came â€œin search of paradiseâ€, the journey through the illustrious history and myths of Sri Lanka is nothing short of mesmerising. But for the locals, these touristsâ€™ aides, fear and uncertainty about their future dominate their lives. Amid the challenges, these moments become their sole means to earn income and contribute to their efforts in revitalising the tourism sector, which once played a significant role in the nationâ€™s economy.

"Actor Prakash Raj, a man of many talents, has spent over four decades in the Indian film industry. He has acted in all four South Indian languages as well as in Hindi. He aces his roles in parallel cinema as well as commercial cinema. But, like any actor, he too has been rejected for roles, but the only difference is the rejection has never got to him. In his words, the actor has lived his life on his terms, personally and professionally.
In a new interview, Prakash opened up about facing rejection. He told Film Companion, â€œRejection has never affected me. I have seen the politics behind the rejection also. I understand them and I have empathy towards them because that is how they could survive. Probably, I have chiselled myself in a different way.

"Filmmaker Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Animal is on a downward spiral at the Indian box office. After earning Rs 13.85 crore, Rs 12.72 crore, Rs 10.25 crore, Rs 8.75 crore in the last four days, respectively, the Ranbir Kapoor-starrer will earn around Rs 4.3 crore on Friday, according to early estimates posted at 6 pm by trade website Sacnilk. The film has now completed two weeks in theatres. The movieâ€™s total collection in India stands at Rs 481.14 crore.
There is anticipation about whether Animal will enter the Rs 500 crore club this weekend. Currently, there is no significant competition for the movie at the box office. Although released alongside Vicky Kaushalâ€™s Sam Bahadur, Animal outperformed it by tenfold on the opening day. With less than a week to go before the release of Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Dunki and Prabhas starrer Salaar, the film continues to mint moolah.

"The thing about fairy tales is that a lot of the time these involve a dolled-up Princess looking out the window of a fancy tower waiting to be swept off her feet.
And there are few fairy tales to parallel that of Priscilla Presley nee Beaulieu, who found herself at 14 being courted (but strangely not coveted) by a rock star who had the world, especially its women, swooning over him."
"Actor Prabhas is looking forward to the release of Prashanth Neelâ€™s Salaar Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire, which, in his opinion, will present him in a never-seen-before avatar. The film, also starring Prithviraj Sukumaran, is the story of power politics in a fictional town called Khansaar. Prabhas essays the role of Deva, the best friend of Prithvirajâ€™s character Vardharaja Mannaar. He single-handedly avenges his best friend when he is denied the throne of Khansaar, which is rightfully his.
In a new interview with Dainik Bhaskar, Prabhas shared how he prepared for his role, which is different from all the roles he has played so far. He said, â€œThe audience has never seen me play such a character. I am excited for them to see me on-screen in a new light.â€

"On-screen violence is a fast-selling commodity currently in Tamil cinema. Lokesh Kanagaraj ushered in the new bloody chapter with Vikram, and now, he seems to have taken it upon himself to sustain the trend. The filmmaker has chosen to present Fight Club with his newly-found production house G Squad. Drug is the common enemy of Lokeshâ€™s films and Fight Club, directed by Abbas A. Rahmath. But it is also the enemy that never gets slayed in either universe. All through Fight Club, there are generous shots of people smoking cigarettes, beedis, joints, and bongs. The clouds of smoke emanating from the mouths and nostrils of the members of this Fight Club are shot with a great sense of aesthetics by cinematographer Leon Britto, who has also shot North Madras with the same brilliance. The rustic style of the film makes drugs more enticing and glamorous than its supposed intention, which is to depict drugs as the root of all evil in that part of society.
Take the name Fight Club for instance. The film is not about a fight club, but North Madras, where fights and violence are portrayed to be the order of the day. Thus, the idea behind naming it after David Fincherâ€™s era-defining film seems to be only to cash in on the popularity and market the film as something as bloody as the Hollywood movie. Naturally, the intention of depicting the problems with drugs takes backstage, and the celebration of it takes centerstage. The â€˜social messageâ€™ is just an excuse for a stylish portrayal of drugs, bloodshed and violence. In a way, such a trend softens the blow of the intention, which is far worse than the unabashed celebration of the perceived evils. While Fight Club has such ethical and moral problems, as a film, it is easily the most engaging gangster movie in recent times."
"The mere sight of Mark Wahlberg on the poster for a family comedy film â€” posing, by the way, with a baby strapped to his chest â€” is enough to zap you back to 2005. The Family Plan, the latest in Appleâ€™s never-ending streak of big-budget star vehicles that nobody knows even exist, is about as forgettable as they come. Perhaps the only engaging thing about it is that baby, and the sneaking suspicion that it might be entirely AI-generated.
He moves his arms around and everything. In fact, director Simon Cellan Jones often cuts back to the baby for reaction shots in between fight scenes, as if the baby is some â€˜mamajiâ€™ in an Ekta Kapoor serial, caught in the middle of that weekâ€™s family drama. With movies like The Family Plan, it becomes the viewerâ€™s responsibility to entertain themselves. And wondering if the baby is real or not is a good way to pass the time. If you donâ€™t quit within 10 minutes, that is. Certainly, Wahlberg doesnâ€™t seem to be in any sort of mood to hold your interest."
"Ali Fazal has worked in many international films and in India too, the actor is known for picking up varied roles. But several years ago, when Ali was still in the early stages of his career, he once worked in a film that he now describes as a â€œcheap horror filmâ€. The Mirzapur actor recently spoke about the â€œmany paaps (sins)â€ that he has done and recalled his experience of making a film called Khamoshiyan, which also starred Sapna Pabbi and Gurmeet Choudhary.
Speaking to Cyrus Broacha on his YouTube channel, Ali said that Khamoshiyan was a â€œbad filmâ€. The movie was produced by Mahesh Bhatt and written by Vikarm Bhatt, who later took over the film as a â€œshadow directorâ€. Ali recalled, â€œVikram Bhatt came on board to shadow direct this other boy Karan (Darra, director).â€

"Raveena Tandon is returning to the digital space after impressing viewers with her performance in the Netflix series Aranyak. She will be next seen in the Disney Plus Hotstar series Karmma Calling, where she will be essaying the role of Indrani Kothari, a rich and ultra-glam woman from Alibaug society. The series is an adaptation of the American TV series Revenge, inspired by Alexandre Dumasâ€™ 1844 novel The Count of Monte Cristo.
The makers shared a glimpse of the series on Friday. In it, Raveena as Indrani announces, â€œTo succeed, there are no rules. Thereâ€™s no right or wrong.

The actor also discussed the disappointment of losing opportunities like Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, for which he was initially selected.
In an interview with Times of India, Prateik revealed that his family tricked and sent him to a rehabilitation center when he was 18, as he was always intoxicated, making communication difficult. The actor said that he felt lost and suicidal at the rehab centre. Prateik later relapsed when he felt the industry treated him unfairly. Frustrated with his films being shelved, he turned to alcohol and drugs once again at the age of 25.

"Actor Urvashi Dholakia, who is best known for her work in daily soaps and reality shows, opened up about her love life. In a new interview, Urvashi said that she hasnâ€™t found true love in nearly three decades after her divorce. She tied the knot at 16, gave birth to twin sons at 17, and was separated by 18. Since then, Urvashi said in an interview with Siddharth Kannan, she has seriously dated somebody only once, because she doesnâ€™t believe in casual relationships. She said that she has now made peace with the fact that she wonâ€™t find true love, but said that nobody can love her like her parents did.
Asked if people tried to hit on her when she returned to the industry after her divorce, when she was single but in an emotionally vulnerable place, Urvashi said, â€œNo, not at all. Obviously, along the way, people feel attractions, but I was too focused. I would friend-zone a lot of people. Whenever I got the sense that they had ulterior motives, I would put a stop to it right there. I was very clear.â€"

"Arijit Singh travels all over the world for his shows and he recently recalled an incident when he was performing in Australia and left a suite trashed. Arijit shared that comedy icon Kapil Sharma was also with him when this incident occured.
Talking to The Music Podcast YouTube channel, Arijit recalled that the organisers had given him a suite but since he was in a hurry to get to his show, he changed and left the suite without unpacking. â€œAfter the show, everyone wanted to party. I said my room is really big, letâ€™s go there,â€ he said and added, â€œKapil Sharma was also there.â€
Recalling the party, Arijit shared, â€œSo we went there and partied for some 5-6 hours. We trashed the entire room, it was a like dustbin by the end of it. Then we had to go out but as we were leaving, I saw a womanâ€™s sandal and dress in the room and everyone started looking at me. I said I have no idea about it and we were all laughing and left.â€ As they were leaving, they saw a few people heading towards their room which confused them.

â€œAs we locked the door and were stepping out, we saw 2-3 people heading towards our room. I was thinking why are they coming here? They opened that room with their key and went in, and we ran from there. We ran and had no idea where we were going. After a while, we came back and saw those people were fighting at the reception,â€ he recalled with a laugh and explained that it was actually the organiserâ€™s suite that they had accidentally trashed. â€œIt was actually the organiserâ€™s room but they gave it to me before the show so I thought itâ€™s my room,â€ he shared.

"The Indian music industry has come a long way from the time when songs were recorded with instruments live and in one take to now, when an entire song can be produced by people sitting in different parts of the world. Auto-tune, which is often perceived as a way to turn non-singers into singers, has also found a way in the Indian music industry but Arijit Singh has now explained that auto-tune is a processing tool thatâ€™s used by most music composers and cannot turn non-singers into singers. Arijit also revealed that AR Rahman was the first composer in India who started using this tool effectively, but he added that Rahman doesnâ€™t use it anymore.
Speaking to the YouTube channel The Music Podcast, Arijit explained, â€œAuto-tune canâ€™t turn a non-singer into a singer. Itâ€™s not like that you sing anything, apply auto-tune and it will sound like itâ€™s in tune. Itâ€™s not possible.â€ Explaining different settings of the tool, Arijit added that Rahman found a way to use it and that really worked with the audience. â€œWhen people really liked to listen to Rahmanâ€™s songs, it was him actually who started using auto-tune in a very subtle way,â€ he said and added, â€œThatâ€™s how a lot of singers started sounding beautiful.â€

Fighter teaser, which came out earlier this month, had Hrithik as Squadron Leader Shamsher Pathania, Deepika as Squadron Leader Minal Rathore, and Anil Kapoor as Group Captain Rakesh Jai Singh.

"Even though the allure of the entertainment world draws many young ones into its fold, rarely anyone looks beyond their cuteness and natural performances to understand the toll it takes on them. First Act, a six-episode documentary by Deepa Bhatia, not only tries to tell their stories of struggle and success but also does the much-needed exploration of their vulnerabilities and difficulties.
The series, at the very beginning, pieces together glimpses of children of different age groups being auditioned. While young children are mostly tongue-tied or fidgety, older kids articulate better when asked about their ambition. Some children have their acting coaches making them chant that they would become a â€˜kalaakar (artist)â€™ one day. Others have their parents drilling the same into their head.

"After Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani said in Rajya Sabha that paid menstrual leave could lead to discrimination against women in the workforce, actor Kangana Ranaut has echoed her statement and said that menstruation is not â€œsome illness or handicapâ€ and â€œwomen donâ€™t need paid leave for periods.â€
Kangana took to her Instagram stories and shared, â€œWorking woman is a myth, there hasnâ€™t been a single non-working woman in the history of mankind, from farming to house chores to raising kids, women have always been working and nothing has come in the way of their commitment to their families or community or nation. Unless itâ€™s some specific medical condition, women donâ€™t need paid leaves for periods, please understand itâ€™s periods not some illness or handicap.â€
Earlier, Smriti Irani, who was previously an actor in television and films, had spoken about this in Rajya Sabha. â€œGiven today women are opting for more and more economic opportunities, I will just put my personal view on this, I am not the officiating ministry. We should not propose issues where women are in some way denied an equal opportunity just because somebody who does not menstruate has a particular viewpoint towards menstruation,â€ she said. Smriti was responding to a query on whether the government is looking into providing a law for menstrual leave.

"So. 2023 is nearly done and dusted. And I have to say that not a single big budget multi-starry Bollywood extravaganza this year was good enough for an admission into the straight-up excellent category. The films that have managed to scrape through to my Top 5 list, with some difficulty I have to say, are those that shifted a register, did something new, or new-ish, or brought a near-defeated star back into the light. But they all come with caveats.
Itâ€™s not just about the money, honey: Bollywood made more of it this year than it has in the past few years put together, especially during 2021-22 when it was groaning under the triple whammy of closed theatres during Covid, a holdover of terrible films which were roundly rejected by the audience, and the onslaught of the Southern films (Pushpa, KGF2, RRR) which were unstoppable at the box office.

She had started her acting journey as a child artist when she was just 6. This desire for a â€˜fairytaleâ€™ life and â€˜loveâ€™ led her to marriage. She said, â€œI was madly in love. Also, at that time, as a woman, the constitution of marriage was instilled in you. My mother came from a conservative mindset and she was clear, â€˜Be independent, but you should get married.â€™ Society was like that at that time. I was 16 and was not mature enough.â€

At the recently held AajTak Agenda, Janhvi spoke highly of her mother and called Sridevi the â€œmost versatile actorâ€. But Srideviâ€™s body of work did weigh down upon her daughters, and the late actor knew it would. â€œMom had only told me that my first film and performance wonâ€™t be compared to her first film, itâ€™ll be compared to her last film and she said to me, â€˜This kind of pressure I wouldnâ€™t even want my enemy to have.'â€

"Actor Bobby Deol, who played the antagonist in the recently released Animal, said he didnâ€™t think of his character as a villain but as someone with childhood trauma. The 54-year-old actor is receiving praise for his brief appearance as Abrar Haque, the menacing mute gangster in Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s film, fronted by Ranbir Kapoor.
Deol, who returned to the big screen with Animal after four years, described Abrar as a â€œfamily manâ€.
â€œI didnâ€™t think of my character as a villain. I saw my character as a child who was traumatised when he saw his grandfather committing suicide, so he loses his voice. He swears to avenge his grandfatherâ€™s death. He is very family-oriented. He is also romantic, he has three wives. He can kill and also get killed for his family,â€ the actor said during a session on the second day of Agenda AajTak 2023 on Thursday.

Animal, also starring Anil Kapoor, Rashmika Mandanna, and Triptii Dimri, is nearing the Rs 800 crore mark in gross worldwide box office collections. The action drama, billed as a father-son story, hit the screens on December 1 in Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam.
Animal may be on its way to becoming one of the highest earning Hindi films of 2023, but it has drawn criticism from a section of social media users for its misogynistic and graphically violent narrative.
Describing violence as an emotion, Deol said people will be able to relate to the degree of violence when they watch the film. â€œThe characters in this movieâ€¦ the animal in them has woken up. They are all like animals. Thatâ€™s why thereâ€™s violence. This is a family drama, a father-son story, and family relationships. It is a reflection of what happens in a society. Definitely action like that is visually created so that people get intrigued but that kind of action, that kind of violence exists in our society,â€ he added.
Stories cannot be written without being influenced by whatâ€™s happening in society, Deol further said. â€œIâ€™m an actor, Iâ€™m not trying to promote any kind of thing. Iâ€™m just an actor portraying something and if the film makes you aware of what is happening around you, itâ€™s the beauty of that,â€ he said.

"Monarchies and television shows; both should ideally have sound exit strategies in place before their time is up. Some of the greatest programmes in history have set fire to their reputations because of substandard final episodes. And for Netflixâ€™s The Crown â€” like its subject, the last remaining survivor of a bygone era â€” the pressure to nail the landing is doubly difficult. Faced with glossier, more algorithmically savvy competition, the showâ€™s popularity in recent years has dwindled like the monarchy itself.
Much of The Crownâ€™s final season â€” or, to be precise, the six episode second part â€” is dedicated to the idea of clean exits. The Queen, played one last time by the under-appreciated Imelda Staunton, spends most of the final episode pondering her own death, and the episodes before that â€” at least the ones sheâ€™s in â€” wondering if the monarchy has become obsolete. She agrees to introduce some reforms at the advice of Prime Minister Tony Blair, who, in addition to representing the existential threat that it faces, also identifies the crownâ€™s many extravagances. These frivolities, he suggests politely, might be contributing to the publicâ€™s growing alienation from the royals.

"Amitabh Bachchan will soon be hosting his grandson and The Archies actor Agastya Nanda on his quiz show Kaun Banega Crorepati 15. Agastya will be accompanied by his co-stars Suhana Khan, Khushi Kapoor, Vedang Raina, Mihir Ahuja, Aditi Dot and Yuvraj Menda, and the filmâ€™s director Zoya Akhtar. During the episode, the superstar will go down memory lane, revisiting the first time he held Agastya, his daughter Shweta Nandaâ€™s son, in his arms five minutes after he was born.
A promo of the episode was recently shared by Sony TV which had Agastya requesting his â€˜nanuâ€™ to ask him simpler questions. Making his request poetically, Agastya says in the video, â€œNanu aap OG, Nanu aap mahaan, KBC ke sawaal dedo aap asaan (Nanu, you are OG, Nanu, you are great. Please give us easy KBC questions).â€ But Big B refuses to accept his request.

"Ranbir Kapoor-starrer Animal made an impactful entry at the box office with record breaking numbers in its initial days. However, in its second week, the film is experiencing a consistent decline in box office numbers.

Animal dominated the box office until Sunday, amassing an impressive Rs 36 crore on that day. However, its box office performance took a turn for the worse starting from Monday, experiencing a substantial 61 per cent fall with collections amounting to Rs 13.85 crore.

Fifth placed Charli XCX from the UK was the biggest singing star internationally of a South Asian heritage and accomplished a lot this year, from hit single releases to blockbuster live performances globally.
She is followed by Ranbir Kapoor (sixth) for delivering the yearâ€™s most impactful movie performance with blockbuster hit Animal.

"A mention of Raj Kapoor will be incomplete without talking about the iconic RK Studios. Raj Kapoor, thespian, actor, director, producer and showman, made his first movie appearance at the age of 10 in the film Inquilab (1935). Son of actor Prithviraj Kapoor, hwas also a clapper-boy for the famous Bombay Talkies during the late 1930s. Raj Kapoorâ€™s big break came with the lead role in the 1947 film Neel Kamal opposite Madhubala, which was also her first role as a leading lady. The actor was to soon graduate to become a filmmaker and in 1948, at the age of 24, Raj Kapoor established his own studio, RK Films, and became the youngest filmmaker of his time. Raj Kapoorâ€™s directorial debut was Aag starring himself, Nargis, Kamini Kaushal, and Premnath.

"Actor Pankaj Dheer has been actively working in the Indian film and television industry since 1970 and has seen the rise and fall of many stars. But in his opinion, there is no better human being like Salman Khan and no better success story than Amitabh Bachchanâ€™s in the Indian film industry. In a new interview, the actor, who became a household name with his role of Karn in BR Chopraâ€™s Mahabharat, talked about his experience of working with Bachchan, Salman Khan and Irrfan Khan.
Dheer said that Salman grew up in front of his eyes and he never imagined that he would become such a big star when he used to see him play cricket with his brothers in Bandra, Mumbai. Dheer also got to work with Salman in the films, Sanam Bewafa (1991) and Tumko Na Bhool Paayenge (2002).

"Shah Rukh Khan has been in the movies for over three decades now and 2023 has been the most successful year for him so far in his career. But, back in the early 1990s, when Shah Rukh started his journey in the movies, it wasnâ€™t just about chancing upon one great role after another but he had to actually strategise as to how he could become one of most desired actors in the industry. Actor-producer Vivek Vaswani, who worked with SRK in those days and helped in launching his career in the movies, recently recalled how he promised to make Shah Rukh a star when the actor landed at his doorstep.
In a chat with Film Companion, Vivek said that when SRK was still transitioning from television to films, he would travel back and forth from Delhi as his mother was unwell and every time he landed in Mumbai, Vivek would pick him up from the airport. Until one day, when SRK landed at his house at 4 am with two big bags. Vivek recalled, â€œHe said will you do a film with me? I have been saying it for 2 months, you are the one who is rejecting it.â€ When Shah Rukh asked Vivek what kind of film he would make with Shah Rukh, the producer had a very clear vision. â€œI said itâ€™s your launch film so it has to be you and thatâ€™s where Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman was born,â€ he recalled.

"Sonu Nigamâ€™s latest song â€œSun Zaraâ€, released by T-Series on December 2, landed him into a controversy as Pakistani singer Omer Nadeem claimed that the song is a copy of his song, â€œAye Khudaâ€, which was released in 2009. He took to social media to call out the makers for not even crediting him for the original composition. But when Nigam came across Nadeemâ€™s post on Instagram, he asserted that he didnâ€™t know about the singerâ€™s version of the song. The Indian singer also apologised to the Pakistani singer for unknowingly singing his song.
A week ago Nadeem had shared clips of both â€˜Sun Zaraâ€™ and â€˜Aye Khudaâ€™ on Instagram and wrote, â€œIâ€™ve reached a point in my life where I couldnâ€™t care less about these things. But hey, if youâ€™re going to do it, at least toss a little credit to the OG track. If youâ€™re gonna pull this off, couldâ€™ve at least done it with some finesse.

"Ranbir Kapoor is celebrating the biggest hit of his career with Animal and while the actor is enjoying his best phase professionally now, he was enjoying just as much in his personal life when he was filming for the Sandeep Reddy Vanga film. Last year, when Ranbir welcomed his daughter Raha with wife Alia Bhatt, he was in the middle of Animalâ€™s shooting process. In fact, the day he brought Raha home from the hospital, he rushed to the set of Animal just a few hours later.
In a recent chat with YouTuber Vanshaj Saxena, Animal actor KP Singh said that he met Ranbir for the first time on the day he brought Raha home. â€œHe had just dropped off Raha from the hospital to his house and came to the set straight away.

"Itâ€™s 22 years to Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham and naturally time for some tiny nuggets to be revealed. Actor Kajol has shared behind-the-scenes stories from the making of the mega Karan Johar directorial, which clocks its anniversary on Thursday.
Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham was Karanâ€™s second directorial after the blockbuster debut Kuch Kuch Hota Hai.

"Despite being extremely controversial, Ranbir Kapoor-starrer Animal is one of the biggest hits of the year. Actors like Siddhant Karnick and Triptii Dimri, who appear in the film in supporting roles have been defending the film and now actor KP Singh, who plays Ranbirâ€™s cousin in the film, has opened up about some behind-the-scenes details from the making of the film and said that director Sandeep Reddy Vanga would abuse people who would be having fun during the shoot.
Speaking to YouTuber Vanshaj Saxena, KP Singh said that the film was like Vangaâ€™s â€œbabyâ€ and â€œhe knew every little detail of every scene and he would go into the tiniest of details while shooting.â€ He added that Sandeep would be extremely serious during the shoot and if he saw anyone laugh during the shoot, he would get abused by the director. He shared, â€œScene ke time pe mazak nahi karte the bilkul bhi. Koi door se bhi hasta hua nazar aa gaya toh unko gaali padti thi. (While shooting a scene he would not be making jokes and all. If he even spotted anyone laughing, he would get abused).â€

"Musician Arijit Singh has opened up about how he shapes his voice. He said that when he started out, he wanted to be like Sonu Nigam, discussing how now people aim to be like â€˜Arijit Singhâ€™. The singer also revealed about his singing process and said that he has worked very hard.
On The Music Podcast, Arijit said, â€œItâ€™s never about the voice; itâ€™s just about the singing. I have worked very hard to create textures in my voice. Itâ€™s like sculpting your voice, because itâ€™s not as if my voice matches Shah Rukh Khan. You practice a lot at night till your throat gets tired, and you go to sleep, when you record the next morning, your baritone opens up.â€

Kareena has now opened up about working with the two actors and said that they all come from different â€˜worlds.â€™ Jaideep also revealed how he did not make an effort to talk to Kareena on sets because he is bad at small talk.
On Netflixâ€™s The Film Actorsâ€™ Roundtable 2023, Kareena said, â€œI feel Vijay and my chemistry, the fact that we have never worked together and the fact that we have come from different worlds, by that I donâ€™t mean our performances, just the circumstances of our lives are different. We never crossed paths. So somehow that also helped in the performance. They are from NSD and I am from the K3G school of acting.â€

"Aditya Roy Kapur and Ranbir Kapoor share a warm friendship with each other and in the latest episode of Koffee with Karan, Karan Johar said that Aditya often becomes the â€œglorious, gorgeous punching bagâ€ for Ranbir. Karan said that the Animal actor likes to believe that Aditya â€œknows nothing about anythingâ€ when in fact that is not the case. Karan recalled the time when Ranbir mocked Aditya for not having watching the Hindi film Sholay, which is often considered as one of the best Indian films of all time.
Karan said that he enjoys when he is hanging out with both Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani actors and said, â€œAdi becomes like the glorious, gorgeous punching bag because Ranbir believes he knows nothing about anything. I remember that one time when he asked him â€˜you b**tard, you have seen Sholay?'â€ Aditya interrupted Karan and said that â€œitâ€™s actually the opposite.â€ â€œIt might be about a few things, about films and all, you know a lot more but yeahâ€¦â€ he said as Karan finished his sentence, â€œRanbir is not exactlyâ€¦ Heâ€™s not some pop culture phenomenon as he would like to believe.â€

"Ranbir Kapoor-starrer Animalâ€™s box office collection is inching closer to Rs 800 crore mark globally after spending almost two weeks at the ticket windows. Directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, Animal has managed to maintain its ground at the box office despite collections dipping everyday in its second week. According to industry tracker Sacnilk, the film minted Rs 10 cr all-India net on its second Wednesday, its lowest figure since its release on December 1.
The filmâ€™s total now stands at Rs 467 cr all-India nett. Animal will look to mint in the similar range on Thursday and not slip into single digit as it enters its third weekend, which would be the most crucial one for the film in terms of breaking lifetime records of some of the films it is competing with â€“Gadar 2 and Pathaan.

"Karan Johar recently hosted Aditya Roy Kapur and Arjun Kapoo on the latest episode of Koffee with Karan. Though they didnâ€™t spill major gossip, Aditya blushed and played it coy when asked about his rumored relationship with Ananya Panday. He didnâ€™t confirm the rumor but praised Ananya.
On the show, Karan asked, â€œRumour has it that you are dating Ananya Panday?â€ Aditya replied and said, â€œKaran, you said on your show, â€˜Ask me no secrets and Iâ€™ll tell you no liesâ€™. I remember this.â€ The filmmaker then told Aditya that Ananya said on his show that she was feeling â€œvery Ananya Coy Kapur.â€ Replying to this, Aditya said, â€œAnd I am Aditya Joy Kapur as of now.â€ Karan countered his answer and said, â€œYou mean youâ€™re joyously in a situationship?â€ Aditya said, â€œIâ€™m quite joyous.â€ He also said that Ananya is â€˜blissâ€™ and â€˜pure joy.â€™ A situationship is an undefined romantic relationship between two people that often lacks commitment.

"Karan Johar started the current season of Koffee with Karan with a bang as he invited Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh to his couch and the couple opened up about their love story and relationship, and discussed details that they had never shared with the world before. But, the reaction to the episode from netizens wasnâ€™t all that positive. Deepika specifically faced a lot of trolling after she said that she dated other people after meeting Ranveer. Karan, on the latest episode of the show, said that this reaction â€œangeredâ€ him.
In a chat with Aditya Roy Kapur and Arjun Kapoor, Karan said that he believed it to be one of the most â€œhonest and heartfeltâ€ episodes of all time but it had a â€œridiculous kind of after effect.â€ â€œI think all three of us came clean on so much of our emotional heft, so many of our feelings and then there was a ridiculous kind of after effect,â€ he said. Karan explained that the reaction to this episode â€œangeredâ€ him because â€œI thought it was one of our best episodes. They were outstandingly honest, they were earnest, they spoke so much, they shared so much, they were so gracious and then you f**king talk about some nonsense. Iâ€™m like what do you know about somebodyâ€™s personal life and marriage. Tu apne ghar pe dekh na (Look inside your house) is what I wanted to tell all of them. I wanted to show them my f**king middle finger.â€

"For such a minutely manicured piece of â€˜contentâ€™, Kevin Hart & Chris Rock: Headliners Only certainly leaves a lot of wrinkles in plain sight. Whether or not this was by design is another argument altogether. The Netflix documentary is on the surface a noble effort to recreate the magic of The Original Kings of Comedy â€” Spike Leeâ€™s seminal film that united four major Black comedians on the same stage over two decades ago â€” but despite a handful of moving moments, Headliners Only canâ€™t help but feel like covert advertising for a special that Netflix hasnâ€™t even announced yet.
Hart seems to be the orchestrator here. To prove that he doesnâ€™t feel threatened by the far more accomplished Rock, he came up with the idea to do a one-week joint show at three different New York City locations. He even planned a grand gesture for the end. Heâ€™d call the unsuspecting Rock back up to the stage, and then present him with a live goat in front of 20,000 people. Because, heâ€™s the GOAT. Get it? Even when heâ€™s first narrating the plan (to Jay-Z of all people), you canâ€™t help but wonder, â€œThey know that this is a terrible idea, donâ€™t they?â€ But Jay-Z seemed to be very impressed. He even got goosebumps just from listening to Hartâ€™s narration, so what do you know?

"Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s latest offering Animal could well have been the title to a Kabir Singh sequel where he became wealthy and then lost his wife Preeti. Instead, we have Ranbir Kapoor playing Ranvijay Singh Balbir, whose father Balbir Singh is called Indiaâ€™s wealthiest and most powerful man multiple times in the first half. But running a business empire across three time zones means he has no time for his family. In Vanga-land, this fractures his sonâ€™s psyche and turns him into a chauvinistic, sexist, bloodthirsty mass murderer. Single parents and families with fathers whose jobs separate them from their children for monetary reasons, you have been warned.
As I tried very hard to deal with the nausea I felt during the blood-soaked pre-interval sequence, I couldnâ€™t help but think about three things- First, is Balbirâ€™s absence a bigger crime than his wife and extended familyâ€™s wilful negligence of Ranvijayâ€™s troubled behaviour? Second, while all of us carry some resentments, anger or trauma from our childhoods, just how many years can we blame our parents or our pasts for how we deal with the present and future? Thirdly, and most importantly, why does Bollywood find it so hard to present a parent-child relationship realistically? Though Animal was promoted as a father-son relationship carved in blood, it is a film where a man uses his troubled relationship with his father to give in to his latent psychopathic tendencies. But sadly, this is not the first time that we have seen problematic parent-child relationships on screen.

"Actor Anshul Chauhan, who recently appeared in Animal as Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s character Ranvijayâ€™s younger sister Roop, says she is still â€œcoming to termsâ€ with the Sandeep Reddy Vanga directorial. The actor reveals that when she was pitched the film, she wasnâ€™t told the entire story and was only informed about her character and her scenes with the lead actor. Before appearing in Animal, Anshul had starred in Kangana Ranautâ€˜s Tejas, and the actor says she had â€œmore expectationsâ€ from Sarvesh Mewaraâ€™s directorial as it was a â€œbigger and more powerful roleâ€. She, however, is amazed how Animal took over and gave her more recognition for her work than any other projects she has been a part of.
In this interview with indianexpress.com Anshul opens up about her working experience with Kangana and Ranbir and how she is â€œstill processingâ€ Animalâ€™s success and wonders why Tejas flopped.

"Actor Ranbir Kapoor is experiencing the biggest success of his career right now, with the controversial blockbuster Animal, but in an old interview, he appeared to have self-awareness about the kind of popularity he enjoys and the kind of cultural impact that his grandfather, Raj Kapoor, has had. He recalled an anecdote about his grandfather, and said that he can only dream of adulation on that scale. December 14, 2023, marks Raj Kapoorâ€™s 99th birth anniversary.
Chatting with The Big Indian Picture over a decade ago, Ranbir was asked about earlier statements about wanting to become the biggest Indian star of all time. â€œI want to be the best at my job, not just critically acclaimed. I donâ€™t want to do movies where just (people in) the cities know me. I want India to know me. I want to reach the small centres. I want to reach the small villages. If Iâ€™m a part of movies, itâ€™s not just to make myself happy and intellectually masturbate, and say, â€˜What a great performance, look at the nuancesâ€™. Unless every single individual in this country knows my name and likes me, Iâ€™ll never be a big star.â€

"Get ready for an adrenaline-packed journey as the highly-anticipated trailer for Kung Fu Panda 4 has been unleashed, showcasing a thrilling battle between the iconic Dragon Warrior, Po, and his formidable new foe â€“ a shape-shifting Chameleon, voiced by Viola Davis. Jack Black lends his voice again to Po in this latest installment of the beloved Kung Fu Panda franchise, directed by Mike Mitchell and co-directed by Stephanie Ma Stine.
The trailer kicks off with Master Shifuâ€™s announcement that Po is set to embark on a new chapter of his journey â€“ to become the Spiritual Leader of the Valley of Peace. However, as Po attempts to meditate and seek inner peace, the challenge of maintaining focus becomes hilariously intertwined with his thoughts of dinner. The stage is then set for a formidable foe as the Chameleon emerges, vowing to â€˜possess the Kung Fu of every master villainâ€™ to attain unmatched power. In response, Po assembles an army of the â€˜best crooks and criminalsâ€™ to counter the looming threat.

"Don Palathara is an expert in exploring and exposing the different shades of human behaviour. â€œEvery edit is a lie,â€ cinema legend Jean-Luc Godard famously said once. In Don Palatharaâ€™s movies, we seldom come across a single character that undergoes edits or refinement. It appears as if each person is depicted in the most raw and unfiltered manner possible. They arenâ€™t necessarily good or bad people; they can be both. Or, better to say that they are brutally and unapologetically themselves.
The filmmakerâ€™s latest drama, Family, which premiered at the 52nd International Film Festival of Rotterdam (IFFR) and was recently screened at the 28th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK), too is a testament to this. Set in a quaint hamlet perched atop a hillock in the captivating landscapes of Idukki district, Family serves as an in-depth examination of the individuals in the community leading unassuming lives and also the closely-knit society they collectively form, where boundaries and personal spaces are nonexistent. The people, mostly following Christianity, are so interconnected that even the minutest events in their lives become common knowledge among all.

"Shah Rukh Khan was still a newbie in the movie business when he landed a three-film deal with actor-filmmaker Rakesh Roshan, as per his close friend and producer Vivek Vaswani. In a recent interview, Vivek recalled how Shah Rukh left Rakesh stunned with his knowledge of the business and landed a part in the promising movie King Uncle, which starred Jackie Shroff in the lead role. Not just that, he even got a three-film deal with the filmmakerâ€™s company Filmkraft even though he had not appeared in even one movie until then.
In a chat with Film Companion, Vivek shared that he arranged for a meeting between Rakesh and Shah Rukh. Vivek was well aware that the role of Jackieâ€™s brother in King Uncle was yet to be cast and he suggested SRKâ€™s name for the same. When Rakesh met Shah Rukh, he asked the actor point blank, â€˜Why should I cast you?â€™ Vivek recalled that he had coached SRK and explained him everything about the business and the actor just turned on the charm when he made his case. As per Vivek, the role that Shah Rukh wanted was going to be offered to Salman Khan who was already a star at that time.

"Suniel Shetty became an action star in the 1990s but in the last few years, the actor has been known for ageing gracefully and promoting a healthy lifestyle, instead of starring in movies. In a recent interview, Suniel spoke about the same and said that while he receives a lot of love from his fans, he also understands that they arenâ€™t willing to spend their money to buy a ticket for his film. Suniel shared that he acknowledges the missteps he might have taken through his selection of movies and admitted that his work in movies has been irrelevant since 2014.
Suniel said that he made some changes in his career and moved away from the action genre after he realised that his movies might be working for the world but they werenâ€™t necessarily working for his family. He shared with ANI, â€œEven though my films were working, when I came back home, the films didnâ€™t work. After showing my parents the film, my wife and my daughter, they said, â€˜Very good,â€™ and then they said, â€˜Ramu Saridon hai toh de do ek (Give me a Saridon if you have one).â€™ I heard that.

"Bollywood actor Vicky Kaushal initially collaborated with director Meghna Gulzar in her critically acclaimed 2018 film Raazi. The duo reunited for Sam Bahadur, which released in theatres on December 1. As Meghna celebrates her 50th birthday on Wednesday, a video from the trailer launch of Sam Bahadur is going viral. The video shows Meghna lauding Vickyâ€™s unwavering dedication to his roles.
At the trailer launch, Meghna was asked if Vicky is her muse. Lauding his work ethic, she said, â€œI love him as a person and I love him as an actor and then you put him in the role of Sam Manekshaw, who I completely adulate. So, a lot of time when I was loving what he was doing, I was not sure that I am loving Vicky Kaushal the actor or I am loving what he was doing with Sam Manekshaw. Having said that, right from Raazi, when there is a character that you will know that this name will come to your mind, then you donâ€™t think left and right. It happened with Raazi, it happened with Sam. Because I know that he will give more than what I am expecting. He will make it his own and thatâ€™s what exactly he has done.â€

Additional details from the show have now surfaced, shedding light on Adityaâ€™s discussion about being labelled â€˜the thirst trapâ€™ and how he leverages this image in his popular web show, The Night Manager.
During the show, host Karan Johar queried Aditya about whether he has grown weary of being termed a â€˜thirst trap.â€™ According to Bollywood Hungama, Karan asked, â€œDo you feel objectified for your sexy persona, youâ€™re called a thirst trap? Everytime people talk about you there is a glaze like a certain kind of sexiness that is talked about and then you do a show which is hugely successful called The Night Manager where you are also unabashedly, unapologetically sexy walking strutting around you in cleverly constructed shorts, obviously, there is an image you are also playing to, do you sometimes feel like, â€˜I am more than my looks.â€™â€

"It will be a star war at the box office on December 21 and 22 with the simultaneous release of Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Dunki and Parbhasâ€™ Salaar. While the advance ticket sales for both films are yet to start in the domestic market, the makers of both films have already opened advance bookings overseas. Initial reports suggest that Salaar will take a significantly higher start overseas and Dunki will trail by a substantial difference.
Until Tuesday afternoon, Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s drama Dunki did a business of $566k, with $185k coming from North America, $68k from the UK and $120k from Australia, reported Box Office Worldwide. According to a TOI report, in the US, the film has sold almost 5400 tickets across 320 locations for 915 shows.

"Director Ram Gopal Varma joined the chorus of Animal defenders in saying that movies donâ€™t influence society; itâ€™s the other way around. He said that films were changing behavioural patterns of audiences, people would have become gangsters after watching Sholay. In an interview with News9 Live, he also said that the controversial Animal cannot be categorised alongside Angry Young Man films such as Deewaar and Agneepath.
â€œOne of the most successful films of all time is Sholay. People loved Gabbar Singh. They saw it multiple times, mainly for Gabbar Singh. Gabbar Singh is evil. He cuts off the copsâ€™ hands, he massacres his family. Youâ€™re basically creating entertainment. No one takes a film seriously. When you saw Mad Max, nobody started going on bikes in high speed. Sholay is the biggest hit; nobody became a dacoit. Because Satya worked, nobody became a gangster. Itâ€™s a stupid argument to say a film can influence. At most, it can influence clothes or hairstyle.â€

"Remember the first time you went out with them? Not those who turned you off instantaneously or the ones you found problematic or not worth a shot, but that one person or the ones who provided you with memorable first dates? Those moments of opening up to each other slowly, ensuring that there is no TMI, while also trying to understand their likes and dislikes, sharing the most basic of details about each other, and unexpectedly delving into serious topics in tandem.
Rinoshunâ€™s first Malayalam feature film, Five First Dates, which was recently screened at the 28th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK), revolves around Shalini (Noila Francy) and depicts five different dates she went on at different points in her life, in a chronological manner starting from her college days. The film also traces her life journey, illustrating the evolution of her ideologies and mindset, with a particular focus on her gradual self-discovery and understanding of her sexual orientation.
Employing an episodic plot structure, the film begins by depicting Shalini in college, embarking on a date with a young man. Despite his regressive behaviour and offensive remarks that reveal his misogynistic and queerphobic views, Shalini, still in her â€œideal girlâ€ phase, remains somewhat naive. Even in the face of these remarks, she rarely confronts him and continues with the date. By skillfully setting a significant portion of this encounter in a park, Rinoshun also underscores the immaturity in Shaliniâ€™s thoughts and the overall nature of the date.
ADVERTISEMENT
On the contrary, her second date takes place in a parked car when she is older. During this segment, it becomes apparent that Shalini has gradually evolved and is almost the opposite of the person she was in college. Now, she smokes, emphasising that it is not an empowerment act but a personal preference. Shalini asserts that she smokes because she enjoys it, requiring no further explanation, thereby highlighting her enhanced understanding of gender politics. Although the man in this scenario appears more progressive than the first, making nonsensical statements like â€œthe purpose of life is to procreate,â€ Shalini doesnâ€™t hesitate to correct him with logical facts, a departure from her former self.

Her third date, on the other hand, is far more mature, taking place with a budding filmmaker inside his flat. They engage in conversations about a variety of topics, spanning books, films, philosophies, and life. While they generally share a similar perspective on life, particularly regarding marriage â€“ both stressing that itâ€™s not a priority â€“ they also acknowledge and discuss their differences in a mature manner. Towards the conclusion, she even expresses the possibility of envisioning herself marrying him if necessary, highlighting the warmth she experienced in the company of such a sensible person.
Moving on to the fourth date, arranged by her family with a potential groom, it begins with her frustration over his tardiness. She explicitly states at the outset that she only agreed due to her motherâ€™s insistence and plans to leave once they conclude the meeting. However, as the conversation unfolds, she finds him intriguing. Despite being quite different from her in nature, he avoids condescension or displaying a man-child attitude. When she asks how he would react if she discovers one day that she is interested in women, he responds supportively, encouraging her to explore her actual sexual orientation by going on a date with a woman. For an older Shalini, who has likely weathered lifeâ€™s challenges and is no longer the completely rebellious person she once was, this date leaves a lasting impression. Towards the end of the episode, she even reflects on the entire date during the journey home, a rare occurrence in the film up to that point.
In the last episode, Shalini is depicted on a trekking date with a schoolteacher, Afreen (Pooja Sreenan), after discovering that she is bisexual. As they explore a forest together, Afreen reveals to Shalini that trees too communicate when we focus our ears on their trunks, emphasising that she is learning more new things in this relationship. Shalini appears to be at her happiest, relishing every moment of the date. Despite fatigue from walking, she persists, choosing to be with Afreen in the present. The film concludes with the two sharing a kiss atop a hillock, where Shalini, once comfortable with PDA, now shivers as their lips meet, highlighting the excitement Afreen brings. While all the other dates are set at night, the one with Afreen occurs during the day, with the sun shining above, symbolising how this relationship has illuminated Shaliniâ€™s life.

A hat tip to Richard Linklaterâ€™s Before trilogy, starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, Five First Dates even features a poster of Before Sunset on the wall in the filmmakerâ€™s flat during the third date. An interesting film adeptly exploring the life of a bisexual woman and the evolution of her ideologies and mindset, Five First Dates ensures that the dialogues feel natural and not forced onto the characters.
Since the dates progress at a real-time pace, Rinoshun allows the actors to carry forward the moments without unnecessary interruptions. This approach extends to the inclusion of mispronunciations in the dialogues, permitting characters to correct themselves and proceed, adding an additional layer of charm to the movie.
On the performance front, Noila Francy shines exceptionally as Shalini, brilliantly capturing and bringing forth the different shades and ethos of the character at various junctures in her life. Noila even adds additional layers to the character at different points, emphasising Shaliniâ€™s growth and realisation, processing more things.
However, Five First Dates falls short on the technical side, as the film rarely explores anything visually beyond the characters, in contrast to the Before trilogy. While the limited budget may have constrained additional visual elements, better planning on Rinoshunâ€™s part, considering his roles as cinematographer and editor, could have enhanced the filmâ€™s visual language. Simultaneously, the use of music and song placement proves to be a detractor, discordant with the filmâ€™s intended tone."
"Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma, who has been a vocal supporter of Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s controversial blockbuster Animal, said that he views the movie as a riff on The Godfather, but from Sunny Corleoneâ€™s perspective. In an interview, he also compared the movie to the films of Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese, and said that he spoke to Vanga about a certain theory that he had about the movie, but Vanga shut him down in his own trademark fashion.
In an interview with News9 Live, RGV said that Animal reminded him of Scorseseâ€™s The Wolf of Wall Street. â€œThe last film I saw where the director himself is not being judgemental about the character was Wolf of Wall Street. Leonardo DiCaprioâ€™s character is immoral, heâ€™s bad, and yet youâ€™re fascinated to see him. I would like to think Animal is a mix of Scorsese and Tarantino.â€

While speaking to Bollywood Hungama, Mithun revisited the time when he was told that Disco Dancer was a superhit and had done a business of over Rs 100 crore. He said, â€œNowadays if a film does less than Rs 100 crore, it feels like it has flopped. At that time, when Disco Dancer did a business of Rs 100 crore, I couldnâ€™t believe it.

"Actor Triptii Dimri, who appeared in a supporting role in the controversial blockbuster Animal, spoke about the portrayal of women in the film, and where she stands on her character, Zoya. She also touched on the divisive scene in which her character is made to lick the boot of Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s Ranvijay, and offered her two cents on going from playing characters with agency in films such as Bulbbul and Qala, to playing a pushover in Animal.
In an interview with The Quint, Triptii was also quizzed about the impact that films have on society, and if thereâ€™s a responsibility that artists feel about what they put out into the world. Describing Zoya as â€˜perfect the way she isâ€™, Triptii said, â€œI see her as a very honest and sincere person, and I wouldnâ€™t want to change a single thing about her.â€ Asked about the shoe scene, and whether it could influence minds, she said, â€œIt depends on person to person. If youâ€™re watching an action film, and the goons are beating up the hero, that doesnâ€™t mean you go and beat up whoever you hate in life. Or, if someone is talking rudely to his wife or girlfriend, that doesnâ€™t give you the license to go home and start talking the same way to your wife, or girlfriend, or whoever.â€

"Actor Bobby Deol made some surprising revelations about the climactic action scene in his new film, Animal. The crime epic ends with his character, Abrar, fighting Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s Ranvijay shirtless on an airstrip. In an interview, Bobby admitted that there is a love-hate dynamic between the two characters, which is reflected in certain creative choices that director Sandeep Reddy Vanga made in the movie.
Speaking to The Quint, Bobby also revealed a key moment that Vanga removed from the theatrical cut, but said that it could be included in the eventual Netflix release, which is expected to be even longer than the filmâ€™s current 201 minute run time. Recalling how Vanga described Abrar to him, Bobby said, â€œThere are these two brothers, they want to kill each other, but thereâ€™s a love that they have for each other. Iâ€™m going to shoot the climax sequence with a song playing in the background, which is about love.â€

"Actor Bobby Deol spoke about the controversial marital rape scene in his new film Animal, and said that it was absolutely necessary. Much has been said about the filmâ€™s depiction of toxic masculinity, and its apparent glorification of misogynist behaviour. Previously, Bobbyâ€™s co-stars in the film Triptii Dimri and Mansi Taxak, also spoke about some of its most controversial moments.
In an interview with The Quint, Bobby said that he doesnâ€™t pay attention to reviews â€“ Animal, starring Ranbir Kapoor, has been trashed by critics â€“ because theyâ€™re a â€˜waste of energyâ€™. He also said that he doesnâ€™t view his character Abrar as a villain at all. Asked about the marital rape scene in the film, Bobby became flustered and said, â€œIâ€™m not trying to promote anything. Yes, it was required. How do you showcase a character in such a short span, show what this man is capable of, what kind of person he is? All these scenes were required.â€ When it was pointed out that films have the power to influence the masses, and that the masses already worship movie stars in India, Bobby said, â€œWe are influenced by what is happening in society as filmmakers. What is written, as a story, is an influence of what is happening in society. It exists in our society. We are not promoting it. We are actors, portraying characters, entertaining people. And if that was the case, this film wouldnâ€™t be a big hit.â€

As Kajol and Kareena sat down with their colleagues from the industry, Jaideep Ahlawat, Sidharth Malhotra, Sanya Malhotra, Amruta Subhash and Tilotama Shome, for a roundtable discussion about their respective performances in various projects on Netflix this year, Kajol asked Sidharth if he ever felt like killing people on the road or did he get road rage in him after playing a serial killer in his 2014 film Ek Villain. Soon, she also expressed her wish to play a dark character on-screen, that too unapologetically.

"Netflix on Tuesday made public its most transparent viewership figures yet. The streamer had previously been reluctant to share data with the public and the investors, mainly to avoid letting the competition in on trade secrets. But after this yearâ€™s SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes, which predominantly focused on revenue sharing in the age of secretive stats, the company has unveiled figures for more than 18,000 titles â€“ both films and shows â€“ on the platform.
The list skewed in the favour of long-form content, mainly because the rankings have been organised on the basis of total hours viewed. The report, titled What We Watched: A Netflix Engagement Report, covers titles that got more than 50,000 combined viewing hours on Netflix from January to June 2023. The list was topped by the first season of The Night Agent, which raked in a total of more than 800 million viewership hours. The second season of Ginny & Georgia took the second spot with 665 million hours. But while a handful of international titles found spots in the top 10, the most-viewed Indian title was Rana Naidu, which took the 336th spot, with 46 million hours viewed.

"Andre Braugher, the Emmy-winning actor best known for his roles on the series Homicide: Life on The Street and Brooklyn 99, died Monday at age 61.
Braugherâ€™s publicist Jennifer Allen told The Associated Press the actor died after a short illness.
The Chicago-born actor had his breakthrough role in 1989â€™s Glory, starring alongside Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington, who won an Oscar for the film about an all-Black army regiment during the Civil War.

Despite the part, he told The Associated Press in 2019 that he struggled to find work in Hollywood where roles for African American actors were â€œfew and far between. Period.â€

But he would establish himself with the role of Det. Frank Pembleton, which he would play for seven seasons in Homicide: Life on the Street, a gritty police drama on NBC based on a book by David Simon, who would go on to create The Wire.
He would win his first career Emmy for the role, taking the trophy for lead actor in a drama series in 1998.
He would win his second for lead actor in a miniseries or movie for the 2006 limited series Thief on FX. Braugher would be nominated for 11 Emmys overall.

Years later he would play a very different kind of cop on a very different kind of show, shifting to comedy as Capt. Ray Holt on the Andy Samberg-starring Brooklyn Nine-Nine. It would run for eight seasons from 2013 to 2021 on Fox and NBC.
Though heâ€™d dipped his toe into comedy in the TNT dramedy Men of a Certain Age, Brooklyn Nine-Nine still represented a major shift for Braugher, known for acting in dark and heavy dramas.
â€œI just felt as though it was an opportunity to do something strikingly different from the rest of my career,â€ Braugher told the AP. â€œI like it because it simply opens up my mind and forces me to think differently. So I think Iâ€™ve become much more sort of supple as an actor, and more open to the incredible number of possibilities of how to play a scene.â€
He would be nominated for four Emmys during the run.

He was married for more than 30 years to his Homicide co-star Ami Brabson. They had three sons.
His death was first reported by Deadline.

"The Ranbir Kapoor-starrer Animal registered a minimal drop in box office revenue on its 12th day of release. According to the industry tracker Sacnilk, Animal made around Rs 13 crore on its second Tuesday, after earning Rs 13.8 crore on Monday. The film delivered the biggest second-weekend haul in Hindi movie history, when it collected Rs 87 crore in total. After 12 days in theatres, Animal has made Rs 458 crore in India.
Animalâ€™s box office collections have been astronomical, and all signs point to Animal leaping past the Rs 500 crore mark domestically this weekend. This is the filmâ€™s last real window to perform, before Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Dunki and Prabhasâ€™ Salaar land in theatres on December 21 and 22, respectively. Animal is all set to become the fourth Hindi film of the year to pass the Rs 500 crore mark, after Pathaan, Gadar 2 and Jawan. The filmâ€™s global gross collections stand at least Rs 750 crore at present, roughly Rs 250-Rs 300 crore shy of Pathaan and Jawanâ€™s records.

"In Talegaon, a small town in Maharashtra nestled between Pune and Lonavala, Avinash Arun read an interview of filmmaker Subhash Ghai, who he was a huge fan of. It mentioned that the filmmaker was a student of Film and Television Institue of India (FTII) and Avinash, who was in his mid-teens, was informed by his father that it was the place where movie makers were crafted. He was fascinated.
Years later, when he told his father, a cotton mill worker, that to get into FTII he needed to make a short film, his father took out Rs 50,00 from his provident fund and handed it to him. It was the first film that Avinash was producing, but it never got made and he lost all the money. â€œMy father didnâ€™t say anything, he was happy that his son at least tried.

In its desperation for prestige â€” director Sam Esmail gives himself the rather narcissistic â€˜written for the screen and directed byâ€™ credit â€” it sacrifices the pulp at its core.
Itâ€™s never really clear if weâ€™re meant to take anything in it seriously. The tone is borderline ridiculous when it isnâ€™t super-serious â€” thereâ€™s no in-between. Julia Roberts plays Amanda, a misanthropic middle-aged woman who drags her husband, Clay (Ethan Hawke), and their two kids, for a weekend getaway in the countryside. As it turns out, they picked the perfect time to rent out a luxury home in the middle of nowhere, because mere hours after theyâ€™ve settled in, the world seemingly ends."
"After carving a niche for himself by portraying two iconic characters in Indian television historyâ€”Mihir Virani from Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi and Rishabh Bajaj from Kasautii Zindagii Kay â€” Ronit Roy made a comeback to films with Vikramaditya Motwaneâ€™s critically acclaimed Udaan. In a recent interview, the actor revealed that he wasnâ€™t the first choice to play the cruel father, Bhairav Singh, in the film. Instead, he was initially cast to play Ram Kapoorâ€™s role. However, due to certain circumstances, he ended up in the role of Bhairav Singh, earning him a lot of praise.
Speaking on Lehren Retro, Ronit recalled, â€œI donâ€™t think Vikramaditya Motwane saw anything in me. I wasnâ€™t cast for the role of Bhairav Singh. I was cast in Ram Kapoorâ€™s role of Jimmy. The actor who was initially playing Jimmy backed out, so I was called to play that role. Then the actor who was playing Bhairav Singhâ€™s role also backed out. Then Anurag asked me to play the role of Bhairav Singh. Him and Vikram would have had a conversation. I just came home from a shoot at 4am and at around 7:30 am, my wife woke me up and told me that Anurag was waiting outside. He told me, â€˜You are doing Bhairav Singh.â€™ I never asked what transpired. They moved me to play Bhairav Singh and brought in Ram to play Jimmy.â€

When Salaarâ€™s posters released, fans found that the aesthetics and the colour tone of the Prabhas-starrer were similar to that of KGF. Some even felt that there were a few hints in the teaser that connected the two films. Now, an interview of a young singer named Theertha has once again left the fans of both films excited as she mentioned Yashâ€™s name along with the cast members of Salaar.
Theertha Subhash, who hails from Kerala, recently won a singing competition in the state. During the interaction about her win, she revealed that she has given her voice for Salaar.

"Giorgia Andriani and actor-producer Arbaaz Khan recently parted ways after dating each other for a few years. While many speculated that Arbaazâ€™s ex-wife, actor Malaika Arora, might be the reason behind their break-up but this is far from the truth, as per Giorgia.

The new promo has Veerappan advicing Rajinikanth against joining politics.
In the short clip, Veerappan can be seen speaking highly of Rajinikanth as he compares the Superstar to former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and star MG Ramachandran. Veerappan says, â€œHe (MGR) struggled. So, he knows about peopleâ€™s suffering. It is hard for someone like MGR to be born. But I very well knew that this Rajinikanth would become like him. He respects everyone. He doesnâ€™t disrespect anyone. He is someone who believes in god a lot.â€ The clip cuts to another setting and Veerappan says, â€œAiyya Rajinikanth averageâ€¦ I am speaking to you. Donâ€™t join anyone and donâ€™t support anyone. Many crocodiles are waiting to exploit youâ€¦ ambush youâ€¦ Donâ€™t be fooled.â€

"Suniel Shetty, known for his roles in action-packed films in the 1990s, recently shared that there was a time when even his family wouldnâ€™t enjoy his films but they didnâ€™t have the heart to say that to his face.

"Despite its problematic gender politics, Karan Joharâ€™s debut film Kuch Kuch Hota Hai achieved cult status, with characters Anjali (Kajol), Rahul (Shah Rukh Khan), and Tina (Rani Mukerji) ingrained in the memories of fans.

The title is the name of his popular character from his blockbuster film Chandramukhi.

Along with the title, the makers also revealed a short teaser of the film, which opens with a shot of Rajinikanth reading a book with a photo of Subhas Chandra Bose.

"Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s latest release Animal is creating noise for everything, be it the filmâ€™s narrative, which is packed with gore and violence; top-notch performances by its cast or the songs, which have become internet sensations. One of the songs, titled â€˜Arjan Vaillyâ€™, has garnered praise from Diljit Dosanjh and many music lovers. But it has also landed in trouble due to its connection with Sikh history.
The song was released by the makers weeks ahead of the filmâ€™s release on December 1 and within three weeks, it garnered over 75 million views on YouTube. At the time of writing, the song is trending in the music section of YouTube.

Superstar Rajinikanth turned 73 on Tuesday and a picture from his old birthday celebration has gone viral on social media. The picture is from his 71st birthday celebration. The viral pictures shows Rajinikanth cutting three birthday cakes, surrounded by his wife Latha, daughters Aishwarya and Soundarya Rajinikanth, and other close family members, all cheering for the beloved actor.
"â€œThalaivar,â€ â€œSuperstar,â€ â€œStyle Mannan,â€ et al, are sobriquets that have long adorned Rajinikanthâ€™s name. With an impressive knack for captivating audiences through his swag, style, charm and ability to connect with the average viewer, Rajinikanth, who turns 73 on Tuesday (December 12), has dominated Tamil cinema for over four decades. Yet, the label of a â€œbrilliant actorâ€ has seldom been attributed to him, and rightfully so. Given the abundance of acting prowess among Indian cinema stars, Rajinikanth, while a decent actor, never took on or received roles that showcased his performance abilities and he, instead, focused on appealing to audiences eager to witness the Rajinikanth they wish to see on-screen.
However, it can never be said that Rajinikanth is a poor actor. In fact, to continue enthralling audiences all these years requires talent that he has consistently exhibited. Even in his first movie, Apoorva Raagangal (1975), helmed by K Balachander, there were initial glimpses of his acting potential. Regrettably, only a few directors attempted to tap into this after that."

In an interview, RGV said that South filmmakers are â€˜shell shockedâ€™ by Animalâ€™s success, as he tried to explain why even Hindi movies are trying to emulate South Indian films these days.
Asked about the crisis that Hindi cinema went through a couple of years ago, when it was observed that films from the Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam languages were faring much better, RGV said, â€œIf you take Baahubali as the beginning of (this trend), KGF pretty much solidified it. But the point is, everyone in the South only makes those kind of films. But not all of them workâ€¦ Directors from the South have always been doing that. I donâ€™t know a single Hindi film director from todayâ€™s time who believed in this hero-masala, catering to the front-benchers, not having any logic, creating constant cinematic highsâ€¦ That kind of template, no one had the conviction in Bombay.â€

In just over 10 days of release, the film has made nearly Rs 750 crore worldwide, and has emerged as the biggest A-rated movie in the history of Indian cinema.
In an interview with News9 Live, RGV was asked if Vanga can be described as his true successor, or if his successor has been Anurag Kashyap all along, seeing as how theyâ€™ve shaken up the film industry. RGV said, â€œI would think Anurag is closer to Sandeep. To say it in a clichÃ©, I think Sandeep is a highly commercial version of Anurag Kashyap.

"In 2007, Aditya Chopra, the chairperson of Yash Raj Films (YRF), found himself in a challenging situation. Despite the success of blockbusters like Fanaa and Dhoom 2 in 2006, YRF encountered a series of failures with films such as Ta Ra Rum Pum, Jhoom Barabar Jhoom, and Laaga Chunari Mein Daag in the subsequent year. The lone success for YRF in 2007 was Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Chak De India.
The misfortune continued into 2008, starting with the highly anticipated yet underwhelming film Tashan, which got more attention for Kareena Kapoorâ€™s size zero than the film itself. Other releases like Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic and Roadside Romeo failed to reverse YRFâ€™s fortunes. Though the success of Bachna Ae Haseeno provided some relief, it wasnâ€™t enough to recover from the losses of the past two years.

He told iDream Media that he required only one take to pull the shot off, after which director Sandeep Reddy Vanga came up to him to offer his praise. â€œWhen I was doing the scene in the film, it was about a brother who has lost his brotherâ€¦ As actors, we use incidents in our lives to bring that emotion. We have a bank full of them. My brother means the world to me. When I was performing that scene, it was as if Iâ€™ve actually lost my brother. And thatâ€™s why, when I was emoting, it felt real.â€

"Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan recently visited the holy shrine of Mata Vaishno Devi in Katra. A video of the actor from the shrine went viral on social media. Shah Rukh is awaiting the release of his next film, Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s Dunki. The actor had earlier visited ahead of the release of his last two films, Jawan and Pathaan, which makes this his third visit this year.
In the video, shared by PTI on X, Shah Rukh is seen being escorted by his entourage and a few policemen. He is accompanied by his manager Pooja Dadlani. To avoid the attention of the public, the actor went incognito. He wore a big black jacket and cap to keep his identity hidden.

Dunki, starring Shah Rukh, along with Taapsee Pannu, Vicky Kaushal, Boman Irani and others, is scheduled to hit the theatres on December 21. Recently, the actor explained the meaning of the filmâ€™s title as he wrote on X (formerly Twitter), â€œBecause everybody asks, what does Dunki mean? Dunki means being apart from your loved ones. And when you are with them, one feels the moment should last till the end of time.â€
Not just Jawan, SRK also paid his obeisance at the shrine before the release of Pathaan in January this year. Both films became the biggest blockbusters of the year, earning over Rs 1000 crore each globally.

"Act0r Shakti Kapoor, who has portrayed a special role in Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s Animal, directed by filmmaker Sandeep Reddy Vanga, recently opened up about the divisive response the film is receiving. The actor also called the filmâ€™s lead actor Ranbir Kapoor â€œone of the best actors in the industryâ€ and said that he wishes late actor Rishi Kapoor was alive to see his sonâ€™s success.
The Raja Babu actor said that he is feeling â€œabsolutely amazingâ€ after Animal became successful and is doing â€œgreat businessâ€ as the audience is watching the film â€œagain and againâ€. Discussing the misogyny and violence in the film, he told ETimes that even if one is not watching Animal, there is a â€œlot of violence happening on the television and on OTT.â€ Defending the film, he said that people are watching the film because it has â€œsome good performancesâ€ and not because of the violence in it. He said, â€œSandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s work is amazing.â€
Shakti also opened up about how he wished that his good friend and long-time collaborator Rishi Kapoor was alive to see Ranbir score with his performance in the film. Shakti and Rishi have acted together in films like Yaraana and Prem Rog, among others. He shared Rishiâ€™s relationship with his son Ranbir was â€œamazingâ€ and that they both â€œloved each otherâ€.

"Veteran Bollywood star Jackie Shroff says he has advised actor son Tiger Shroff to â€œtake it easyâ€ as film business is unpredictable. Tiger emerged as an action hero following the box office success of films such as Heropanti, and Baaghi. But his last few films such as Munna Michael, Heropanti 2, Ganapath under-performed at the box office.
Jackie Shroff said hits and flops are part of the movie industry and he has faith in his sonâ€™s capabilities.
â€œI think he (Tiger) needs a good technician and a good release. Thatâ€™s it. The boy has everything, he is an action star. At his age, he is the biggest. I say, â€˜Take it easy, some films will work, some wonâ€™t work, again some will work. This is lifeâ€™.
â€œIâ€™ve done 250 films and not all of them have worked. So, itâ€™s alright. It (film) totally depends on the whole team, it (filmmaking) is a team work,â€ the 66-year-old actor, known for movies such as Karma, Ram Lakhan, Parinda, and Border, told PTI in an interview.

The actor, who currently stars in the movie Mast Mein Rehne Ka, said one has to be appreciative of all that they have accomplished, a formula that he lives by in his life.
â€œEverybody will not get everything in life, it is impossible. So, one has to understand that health, family and friends are important. We should have gratitude for whatever we have. I was happy selling peanuts, then sticking posters on the walls, working in a travel agency, modelling and acting in films, and now Iâ€™m happy planting plants,â€ he said.
Jackie Shroff said he never viewed any work as small. He started with odd jobs before making his acting debut in the 1982 Dev Anand film Swami Dada, in which he played a small role. It was Hero, directed by Subhash Ghai, which catapulted him to stardom.
â€œWhatever work Iâ€™ve got, Iâ€™ve always done that. Like, I remember selling peanuts first, then I got the job of sticking movie posters on the walls, I worked at a garment shop, then joined a travel agency. Then someone asked me, â€˜If I would do modelling?â€™, I did it, then it was like, â€˜Will you do a movie? I did it.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œSo, I kept myself open to doing all kinds of things. I was always sincere and disciplined, whatever work I was given, I did it honestly. I just kept moving and never stressed about anything.â€
Mast Mein Rehne Ka, also starring Neena Gupta in the lead, is a poignant tale of urban loneliness. It was released on December 8 on Prime Video.
The film is written and directed by Vijay Maurya, best known for penning dialogues for Gully Boy, and Darlings among others. Mast Mein Rehne Ka is based on universal themes of second chances in love and life, forgiveness, and redemption. Jackie Shroff said he resonates with the idea of Mast Mein Rehne Ka in life.
â€œPeople often donâ€™t take me seriously, some people laugh at the things that I do, some think Iâ€™m funny, and some are like, â€˜he says anythingâ€™. But there are people who are like, â€˜One should live life this wayâ€™.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œI donâ€™t know any other way but that you just have to be happy, spread happiness, and lead a life that is beautiful. Mast mein raho, there will be tension in life,â€ he added.
Mast Mein Rehne Ka is produced by Payal Arora and Maurya under their banner Made in Maurya.

"Wamiqa Gabbi emerged as a surprise package as she played the role of Niloufer, a struggling actor who finally finds her footing in the film industry, in Vikramaditya Motwaneâ€™s Prime Video series Jubilee. The series, which was an exploration of the world of Hindi cinema, had Gabbi at her best as a confident girl who is not afraid to challenge the ways of society. But when she was called for her look test for the series, she was not that sure of herself. In fact, her nervousness got her rejected by Motwane. Ultimately, it took her a few Instagram reels in Rakhi Sawantâ€™s voice to grab the role.
During a recent interaction with Film Companion, Gabbi shared how she managed to get a role in Jubilee, one of the best web series of 2023, because of her active presence on photo-sharing app, Instagram, which, in her opinion, is â€œquick moneyâ€ and allows her to not fall for any role.

"Actor Vicky Kaushalâ€™s war biopic, Sam Bahadur, had a low second Monday. But having braved the Animal tsunami for 11 full days, the film managed to put up a decent total. According to industry tracker Sacnilk, Sam Bahadur netted an estimated Rs 2 crore on its second Monday. This is the filmâ€™s lowest single-day haul since its release on December 1, but it wasnâ€™t entirely unexpected. Even Animal registered its lowest single-day haul on its second Monday, although it made Rs 11 crore more than Sam Bahadur.

At best, the Meghna Gulzar directorial can now hope to maintain the collections throughout this week to end its lifetime total on a good number in the north of Rs 80 crore.

"At the recent Kolkata International Film Festival, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap engaged in a discussion about misogyny and disrespectful content towards women. Citing the example of Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s recently released film Animal, the filmmaker said that despite the backlash the movie is getting, it has also started a more impactful conversation around misogyny than any other film could.
In a conversation with OTTPlay, Anurag said, â€œYou cannot force responsibility on anyone. People take responsibility for themselves or they donâ€™t. How many people went and watched a film that you considered to be feminist? Only a handful of people watch them and underline if it was a real feminist film or a pseudo-feminist film. A film like Animal has galvanised more feminists in this country than any other feminist film. It has created more discussion around misogyny than any other film. So it is doing something good.â€

"Director Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Animal registered its lowest single-day box office haul on its 11th day of release, as reported by industry tracker Sacnilk. But even the filmâ€™s lowest day is bigger than the opening days that many Bollywood movies have been able to manage in recent years. Animal has been delivering huge numbers at the box office, despite its daunting run time and polarising reception.
On its second Monday, the box office collection of the Ranbir Kapoor-led film stood at Rs 13 crore, which marks a 65.28% decline from Sundayâ€™s earnings (Rs 36 crore). This brings the filmâ€™s total domestic collection to Rs 443.27 crore, with Rs 400.37 crore coming from the Hindi version, Rs 38.8 cr from Telugu, Rs 3.43 cr from Tamil and Rs 0.56 cr and Rs 0.11 cr from Kannada and Malayalam versions respectively.

"Besides restoring Karthik Subbarajâ€™s position as a top Tamil cinema director, his latest venture Jigarthanda DoubleX has brought back a significant fact to the fore: Rajinikanth is the first-ever dark-skinned star of Indian cinema. Karthik, a self-proclaimed fanboy of the Superstar, thanked the actor even in the title card of the film. On top of that, the movie itself is a brilliant ode to Rajinikanth, who broke several norms of Tamil cinema back in the 80s when he emerged as the hero.
Jigarthanda DoubleX, a prequel to Karthiâ€™s sophomore film Jigarthanda, is about Allius Caesar (Raghava Lawrence) a gangster in Madurai, who after an embarrassing incident at a party, resolves to become a hero. A contemporary fair-skinned actor Chinna (Arvind Akash) notes that it is impossible for Allius to become a star in Tamil cinema, where the tone and looks decide everything. Allius is a ruffian with a menacing demeanor which works for his illegal smuggling activity, but he doesnâ€™t know how it is going to lend itself to his silver-screen aspirations. Enters Ray Dassan (SJ Suryah), a pretend-filmmaker, who is forced on a mission to kill Allius. Ray Dassan, in reality, is a coward, who is sent to jail on false murder charges. To get his freedom, he has to kill Allius. The film takes a huge turn post-interval when Ray convinces Allius to move to his tribal village.
ALSO READ | Jigarthanda DoubleX movie review: Karthik Subbarajâ€™s ode to films is part meta cinema, part social commentary
At a particular moment in the film, Allius is asked to speed up the filmmaking as there is a debutant named Rajinikanth, who seems to have grabbed eyeballs with his debut film Apoorva Raagangal (1975). If Allius plans on becoming the first-ever dark-skinned hero, he has to beat Rajinikanth to it. At the surface level, this might just seem like a small hat tip to the Superstar, but the politics behind the ascent of both Allius Ceaser in Jigarthanda DoubleX and Rajinikanth in real life are perfect underdog stories.
ADVERTISEMENT
It has to be noted that before Rajinikanth, there were hardly any dark-skinned actors in the industry. The few that were there often got relegated to villain roles or worse as hitmen of the villain (Pa Ranjith hit out at this by titling his film with Rajinikanth as Kabali, a name generally used for such henchmen). When filmmaker K Balachander, an iconic figure in Tamil cinema, decided to introduce this rather unique youngster in Apoorva Ragangal, he decided to name him after a colourâ€“Rajinikanth, the colour of the night. Not just his name, but his skin complexion would become the subject of numerous jokes and comments in the films that followed. Even in Apoorva Ragangal, his current box office competitor Kamal Haasan calls him a beggar.
Like a lot of dark-skinned actors, Rajinikanth quickly got a lot of antagonist roles like Parattai in 16 Vayathinile. Even the name Parattai loosely denotes a â€˜unkemptâ€™ ruffian. Rajinikanth gradually transformed himself into this hero with grey shades, a characteristic thatâ€™s explored even now by the new-gen filmmakers. Lokesh Kanagaraj, who is set to direct the actor in Thalaivar 170, said he wants to explore the dark side of the Superstar. Thatâ€™s another convention Rajinikanth broke. When everything was in black and white in the mainstream, the superstar often played characters in films like Polladhavan, Billa, and Netri Kann that were unbecoming of a hero. After all, Rajinikanth is the one who made smoking cool in Tamil cinema, when it used to be the symbol of the villain.
His colour has continued to be the talking point of many of his films like Sivaji, where his love interest tries to dismiss him for his skin colour. In Pa Ranjithâ€™s Kaala, the colour was discussed in all seriousness. â€œKaruppu uzhaipoda vannam (Black is the colour of proletarians),â€ proclaims Kaala. Throughout the film, Rajinikanth is seen only in black, a trait that is seen in the members of Dravida Kazhagam, a political movement founded by Periyar. Rajinikanthâ€™s on-screen image will always remain black. And one owes it to Karthik Subbaraj to remind the new-gen about what it must have been like for Rajinikanth back in the 70s."
"Ranbir Kapoor-starrer Animal is slowly losing steam at the Indian box-office. On the 11th day of its release, the film registered its lowest single-day box office haul yet, with Rs 9.14 crore added to its total, as reported by industry tracker Sacnilk at 9 pm. The total collection of the movie now stands at Rs 440.41 crore. However, the film has surpassed the Rs 700 crore mark at the worldwide box office within just 10 days since its release.
Animal has outperformed Sunny Deolâ€™s Gadar 2 at the global box office. The Anil Sharma directorial had minted Rs 686 crore globally. Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s film has also surpassed Rajinikanthâ€™s Jailer and Thalapathy Vijay-starrer Leoâ€™s earnings. Now, Animal is only behind Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s hits Jawan and Pathaan, with Jawan making Rs 1,160 crore and Pathaan earning Rs 1,055 crore worldwide.

The revamped group, now a for-profit endeavour with a larger and more diverse voting body, announced nominations on Monday for its January awards show, after scandal and several troubled years, including one without a broadcast. Cedric the Entertainer and Wilmer Valderrama presided over the announcements from the Beverly Hilton Hotel, where the show will also take place on January 7.

In the best motion picture musical or comedy category, Barbie was joined by Air, American Fiction, The Holdovers, May December and Poor Things.

Poor Things saw nominations for Lanthimos, its actors Emma Stone, Mark Ruffalo, Willem Dafoe, Tony McNamara for screenplay and Jerskin Fendrix for score. Killers of the Flower Moon got nods for Scorsese, for direction and co-writing the screenplay with Eric Roth, and stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone and Robert De Niro.
Barbie tied for second-most nominations in Globes history with Cabaret, from 1972. Robert Altmanâ€™s Nashville remains the record-holder with 11 nominations. It went into the morning as a favorite top, and got a big boost from its three original song nominations, including â€œIâ€™m Just Ken,â€ and one of the yearâ€™s new categories, recognizing cinematic and box office achievement.

Succession was the top-nominated television program, with nine nods including for series stars Brian Cox, Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook and Kieran Culkin.

Movie, Oppenheimer, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, Mission: Impossible -Dead Reckoning, John Wick: Chapter 4â€ and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. Several years ago the Oscars attempted to add a similar â€œpopular filmâ€ category, but it proved to be an immensely unpopular decision and was scuttled amid backlash.
As always there were some big surprises, like Jennifer Lawrence getting nominated for her bawdy R-rated comedy No Hard Feelings for best performance by a female actor in a musical or comedy. She was nominated alongside Robbie, Stone and Fantasia Barrino (The Color Purple), Natalie Portman (May December) and Alma PÃ¶ysti (Fallen Leaves).
The Color Purple was widely expected to do better with the Golden Globes. The adaption of the stage musical got only two nominations total for Barrino and Danielle Brooks for her supporting performance.

WHATâ€™S NEW WITH THE GOLDEN GLOBES?
ADVERTISEMENT
The 81st Golden Globe Awards will be the first major broadcast of awards season, with a new home on CBS. And while to audiences it might look similar on the surface, itâ€™s been tumultuous few years behind the scenes following a bombshell report in the Los Angeles Times. The 2021 report found that there were no Black members in the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which votes on the awards.
Stars and studios boycotted the Globes and NBC refused to air it in 2022 as a result. After the group added journalists of color to its ranks and instituted other reforms to address ethical concerns, the show came back in January 2023 in a one-year probationary agreement with NBC. The network did not opt to renew.
In June, billionaire Todd Boehly was granted approval to dissolve the HFPA and reinvent the Golden Globes as a for-profit organization. Its assets were acquired by Boehlyâ€™s Eldridge Industries, along with Dick Clark Productions, a group that is owned by Penske Media whose assets also include Variety, Deadline, The Hollywood Reporter, Rolling Stone and Billboard. In mid-November, CBS announced that it would air the ceremony on the network on January 7. It will also stream on Paramount+.
WHAT ARE THE GLOBES KNOWN FOR?
The Golden Globe Awards had long been one of the highest-profile awards season broadcasts, second only to the Oscars.
ADVERTISEMENT
The show was touted as a boozy, A-list party, whose hosts often took a more irreverent tone than their academy counterparts. It also only honored the flashiest filmmaking categories â€” picture, director, actors among them â€” meaning no long speeches from visual effects supervisors or directors of shorts no one has heard of.
But the voting body was a small group of around 87 members who wielded incredible influence in the industry and often accepted lavish gifts and travel from studios and awards publicists eager to court favor and win votes.
Some years, the HFPA were pilloried for nominating poorly reviewed films with big name talent with hopes of getting them to the show, the most infamous being The Tourist, with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. In the past decade, theyâ€™ve more often overlapped with the Oscars. The show also recognizes television.
Before the expose and public relations crisis though, no one in the industry took much umbrage with who was voting on the awards. The show had become an important part of the Hollywood awards ecosystem, a platform for Oscar hopefuls and was, until recently, a reliable ratings draw. As of 2019, it was still pulling in nearly 19 million viewers to the broadcast. This year, NBCâ€™s Tuesday night broadcast got its smallest audience ever for a traditional broadcast, with 6.3 million viewers.
WHO VOTES ON THE GLOBES?

"Filmmaker Karan Joharâ€™s Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham remains a timeless classic. Besides the amazing cast, the songs are still fan favorites. Think about the scene where Shah Rukh Khan lands at his home in a helicopter, and Jaya Bachchanâ€™s character senses her sonâ€™s arrival, and the title song starts playing in your head. Ever wondered how they made that song? Lalit Pandit, the composer, recently shared that director Karan Joharâ€™s request was unique â€“ he wanted a bhajan for that moment. The title song of the film Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham was composed by Jatin-Lalit.
In an interview with Rajshri Unplugged, Lalit said, â€œThe most difficult song was the one which looked very simple. It was the title song of the film. Because Karanâ€™s brief was very difficult to comply with. He wanted a bhajan. Bhajans usually have a simplistic tune, it cannot be orchestrated as a huge song. But he did not want that. He wanted a song that Jaya ji is singing for god, Jaya ji is singing for her husband, so it needed to imply both.â€

"Villains make the narrative interesting but unlike the black and white portrayal of negative characters in the past, they are given a backstory in cinema today, says veteran actor Prem Chopra.
The 88-year-old actor, who embodied evil men of all shades in the films of the 70s and 80s, is being praised for his guest appearance in Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Animal. Chopra said the negative characters were not justified in movies earlier and gave the example of his 1973 hit Bobby. Directed by Raj Kapoor, the film starred Rishi Kapoor and Dimple Kapadia in the lead.
â€œIn those days, we were stamped as the bad guysâ€¦ It was in a straight way, whether Prem Chopra, Amrish Puri, Pran sahab or anyone else, it was like, â€˜Yeh gadbad karne wale hainâ€™ (people knew that we were up to some mischief),â€ the veteran actor told PTI in an interview.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œLike, in Bobby, I just had one dialogue and that became very popular. Raj (Kapoor) didnâ€™t have to explain. People knew that he was going to do something,â€ he said, recalling his most famous dialogue, â€œPrem naam hai mera, Prem Chopraâ€.
But in Animal, Prem Chopra said a reason has been given for Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s revenge in the film.
â€œThe narrative was made interesting because of the negative characters (in the past). It is the same even now. They are a very important part of the film. Now-a-days, the difference is every negative character has a reason, how and why he has become a villain.
â€œIn Animal, thereâ€™s a reason why he (Ranbir) is like this and thatâ€™s because his father was shot and he had to take revenge,â€ the actor said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Directed by Vanga of Arjun Reddy fame, Animal showcases a violent world set against the backdrop of a troubled relationship between Ranvijay and his father Balbir Singh, played by Anil Kapoor.
Prem Chopra, whose career has spanned 60 years that saw him feature in many prominent movies such as Do Raaste, Purab aur Paschim, Teesri Manzil, Kati Patang, Souten and Trishul, plays the role of the elder brother of Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s grandfather
The cinema veteran believes the audience has become more appreciative of a good performance, regardless of a positive or a negative role.
â€œPeople have become emancipated, they appreciate it if you give a good reason. Sometime back, people were not able to adjust to the actors who were playing the negative characters.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œWhen a person (who generally plays a) negative character is playing a positive character, they had doubts. In Hollywood, the actors are accepted in both (kinds of) roles, total negative or total positive, the performance matters. TV and all that (referring to OTT platforms) have made them (the audience) more literate about these things,â€ he observed.
The actor also praised Ranbir Kapoor for his performance in the action drama. Animal marks the second collaboration between the duo after the 2009 comedy-drama Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year.
â€œRanbir is a very hardworking actor and performed so well in Rocket Singh. In this film (Animal), he is tremendous. He has done a great job. It is a very difficult and complicated role.
â€œIt is action-oriented but even then, his character has a great background (story). People seem to love him very much. Not just him, even Bobby Deol is very good in a special appearance. All of them are very impactful.â€
ADVERTISEMENT
In movies, Prem Chopra has worked with four generations of the Kapoor family â€” from Prithviraj Kapoor, Raj Kapoor, Randhir Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor, and Kareena Kapoor Khan and Ranbir Kapoor in recent years.
All his co-stars from the Kapoor clan are thorough professionals but his most-favourite was Rishi Kapoor, who passed away in April 2020 after a battle with leukemia.
â€œSome of them gave great performances, like, Prithviraj ji was known as the great actor, then Raj Kapoor was a known superstar and a genius director. Shammi Kapoor had his own style of working. But it was Rishi Kapoor I liked the most. He was very involved when he was working. He would fit into any character easily. He was a great asset to any film that he was working on,â€ he added.
The actor said he has experienced his fair share of highs and lows, but has managed to survive in the film industry.

â€œIâ€™ve been in the profession for more than the last 60 years. Iâ€™m grateful to God. Iâ€™ve never been unfair with my work. Every film for me was a test. Iâ€™m very hardworking, honest, and determined. There have been a lot of embarrassments and controversies but you have to continue doing your work,â€ he said.
Going forward, Prem Chopra said he is looking forward to doing selective work, something like American icon Marlon Brandoâ€™s character in the Hollywood classic Godfather.
â€œIâ€™m open to good roles. It has to be very selective,â€ he added.

"After the release of Dunki Drop 4 â€“ The trailer, the makers have now unveiled a heartwarming song from the upcoming film Dunki. Titled â€œO Maahiâ€, the song features Shah Rukh Khan and Taapsee Pannu. Crooned by Arijit Singh, the composition is by Pritam and the lyrics are by Irshad Kamil. The choreography is by Vaibhavi Merchant. 
â€œO Maahiâ€ is about love that knows no bounds, highlighting how people can do anything to protect their loved ones. The song portrays SRK and Taapseeâ€™s â€˜s journey overcoming challenges imposed by borders between two countries, showcasing their determination to survive together. The duo are in the desert, trying to cross the border illegally. In a scene, SRK impresses with his dancing, following Vaibhaviâ€™s steps perfectly.

"Actor Vrushika Mehta has tied the knot with Saurabh Ghedia. Vrushika, who gained fame with her role in the popular show Dil Dostii Dance, announced the  news on her Instagram handle, where she posted beautiful pictures and a video from her wedding ceremony. The couple had gotten engaged in December 2022.
Sharing the pictures, she wrote in the caption, â€œWith the warmth of family, the laughter of friends, and blessings all around, we found our home in one anotherâ€™s hearts. Saying â€˜yesâ€™ became a promise for a lifetime.â€ In the photos, the couple was seen all smiles."
"Co-writing, directing, producing and starring in his Leonard Bernstein biopic Maestro was a terrifying undertaking for Bradley Cooper that turned into a journey of joy and courage.
A passion project years in the making, Maestro is the follow up to Cooperâ€™s directorial debut, A Star Is Born.
â€œIn the beginning, realising how much work would be involved, I was terrified. But the more work I put in, and then each day, I became more and more at ease with the idea of being able to ask everybody to go on this journey,â€ Cooper told Reuters at the filmâ€™s premiere in London last week.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œBy the end of it, it was just joy and fearlessness.â€
Leonard Bernstein, who died in 1990, was a celebrated U.S. conductor and composer, who wrote classical music and iconic hit musicals like West Side Story.
Maestro focuses on his relationship with his wife, Felicia Montealegre, played by British actor Carey Mulligan, and on his bisexuality.
â€œLenny and Felicia were filled with a lot of passion and we were so excited that we were able to put our energy into a story about people that really loved life and lived life in such a dynamic way,â€ said Cooper.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œAt the time there was so much mutual love for them as a couple, everyone referred to them as Lenny and Felicia. It feels so appropriate that the film is their story and their love story,â€ added Mulligan, who said being directed by her co-star was her â€œfavourite experience everâ€.
â€œIâ€™ve never experienced anything like it,â€ she said. â€œIt didnâ€™t feel like two separate things. Thereâ€™s no acting required, you just are in the scene, I think thatâ€™s a testament to a truly great director.â€
The children of Bernstein and Montealegre were closely involved in the development of the movie. Maestro was made for their family, said Cooper, and everything else, including Oscar talk, is extra.
â€œWe had a really profound relationship with them throughout this whole experience. It really is about serving their parents in this art form and all this other stuff is awesome and itâ€™s fun, but it has nothing to do with why we did it.â€
Maestro starts streaming on Netflix from December 20.

"People are talking about Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Animal, with mixed opinions, but its songs are already a big hit. Bobby Deolâ€™s return to the big screen with the film has proven to be a box office success, breaking multiple records. One scene getting a lot of attention on social media is Bobbyâ€™s entry, dancing to the song Jamal Kudu. In the movie, he plays the character Abrar Haque. Bobby has opened up about the scene and revealed how he got the idea of keeping the glass on his head in the song. 
In an interview with Bollywood Spy, Bobby said, â€œIt is crazy, people are keeping a glass on their dogâ€™s head and dancing. Somebody had worn an exact same suit like mine. Itâ€™s just overwhelming to see all of that.â€

Additionally, Saira shared glimpses of old greeting cards she had personally given to Dilip on his birthdays.
The veteran actor also penned a long note remembering the legendary actor. She wrote, â€œOnce more it is December the 11th, the day of days when the skies are blue with a smattering of dreams like puffy white clouds that seem to be dancing in the skies with happiness and exaltation.

"Actor Triptii Dimriâ€™s performance in the Ranbir Kapoor starrer Animal has been receiving love and praise, with many calling her as the new â€˜national crush.â€™ The actor has now opened up about the brief given by director Sandeep Reddy Vanga for her character Zoya and how he guided her through the process. Triptii plays the role of Zoya, Ranbirâ€™s girlfriend in the second half of the film, but her character takes an unexpected twist.
In an interview with Siddharth Kannan, when the actor was asked â€˜what was the exact point when she fell in love with Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s character?â€™ Triptii said, â€œThere was no point as such. When we were discussing about what exact point she falls in love, there was nothing specific in anyoneâ€™s mind.â€
Triptii then recalled the brief given by Vanga and said, â€œMy director, he was giving me a brief; he said that, â€˜You know itâ€™s a negative character.â€™ â€˜Youâ€™re going in with a motive, but keep all of it inside. On your face I want people to see innocence and love for this guy.  And, â€˜Keeping all of those intentions inside, you have to go in.â€™ And, â€˜We tried really hard to make sure that, you know, that comes through.â€™ And, â€˜For me, I donâ€™t think there was a particular point where she falls for him.â€™ â€˜I think she just sees how, good he is.â€™ And, â€˜She sees the good side of him.â€™â€

Animal also stars Anil Kapoor, Bobby Deol and Rashmika Mandanna in pivotal roles. The film has minted more than Rs 600 crores worldwide.

The evening also featured special performances, including a melodious performance by playback singer Pradeep Kumar and appearances by former participants."
"Distinctly inspired by the tale of slain folk singer Amar Singh Chamkila (also the subject of Imtiaz Aliâ€™s upcoming film starring Diljeet Dosanjh), who was gunned down along with wife Amarjot in Punjabâ€™s Mehsampur just before their performance, SonyLIV show Chamak opens with the shot of the fields, with men and women listening to local folk singer Tara Singh (Gippy Grewal) crooning a Punjabi ditty with his wife Navpreet by his side when the two are shot dead by two unknown men. The similarity of this one part of the story with Chamkilaâ€™s life is uncanny in Rohit Jugrajâ€™s â€œwork of fictionâ€, attempting to showcase the underbelly of the Punjabi music industry.
Cut to 20 years later, and one meets Kaala (Paramvir Singh Cheema), Tara Singhâ€™s son, a Canada-based angsty musician with a bunch of criminal charges on him, who, while running away from the charges, comes to Punjab and discovers his provenance. He then decides to find his parentsâ€™ killers with the help of a retired journalist who once investigated the case.
Since Chamkilaâ€™s death in 1988, three conspiracy theories have done the rounds. These suppositions â€“ that the musician was killed by those jealous of him in the music industry, that it was an honour killing by Amarjotâ€™s family for marrying a man from the Dalit community, and the last being that it was a terrorist attack since his lyrical content was considered vulgar by many who supported and were a part of the then terrorist organisations. The same three theories form Kaalaâ€™s three possible explanations as he hunts for his parentsâ€™ killers.
ADVERTISEMENT
While the premise is well-known, the show is interesting because the hunt for answers remains. The first couple of episodes allow one to dive into the Punjabi music industry, shown with quite some authenticity â€“ the diction and accents are spot on, and Manoj Pahwaâ€™s Pratap Deol as the music mogul and Prince Kanwaljit Singh as a politicianâ€™s henchman are fabulous. But itâ€™s Cheemaâ€™s Kaala, promising in the beginning with those big eyes and just the right look, who is completely lacklustre. He just doesnâ€™t stick.
But what does make an impact is the showâ€™s music and the range that it covers. From rap to folk to Sufi to a typical Punjabi film song, the music of the series is very carefully curated and produced. Every song comes from a deeper, interesting space and is worth a listen. The show also has guest artists, including Mika Singh, Asis Kaur, and Kanwaar Grewal, among others.
But the most ludicrous bit in the first season of Chamak is not the lip sync gone awry in a web series set against the backdrop of Punjabi music (actors lose lyrics, sargams and rhythms far too often). Things become notoriously dotty when a classical guru Jugal Brar (Suvinder Vicky) ties his student Kaalaâ€™s hands, and forces him to fill his mouth with marbles during his vocal riyaz. Besides the cruelty of the practice (also shown in The Kingâ€™s Speech to cure the king of his stammer), I have never heard of it in the world of Indian music. Students always did sewa â€“ domestic work among others (The Disciple portrays it to the tee) and even suffered much at the hands of gurus who were tyrants, but singing with a bloody mouth was definitely not one of them. Unlike his last outing, this time Vicky is lost among some better performances.

Another problematic bit is when the times one lives in today creep from the peripheries. In an achingly naive move, a dialogue â€“ â€œKesri rang chahiye, galti se bhi hara dikha toh gaal laal kar dene hain tumhare,â€ is quite disturbing.

While the series does come close to portraying the complex music industry of Punjab, fraught with crime despite the existence of some of the brightest musicians, it lacks the substance and the gravitas to put a spotlight on this entangled entity. It ends up being a middling mishmash that lacks any solid punch.

"Top 10 most searched movies in 2023 have been revealed by Google as the year draws to a close, with superstar Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Jawaan ruling the charts. On Monday, Google announced the top trending searches in 2023, where the movies section was dominated by both of this yearâ€™s Shah Rukh releasesâ€” Pathaan and Jawan.
In movies, the top 10 searches in India were for Jawaan, Gadar 2 and Oppenheimer. All three films ruled trends and went on to script a success story critically and at the box office. Prabhas-starrer Adipurush took the fourth position â€” the film courted controversy over its dialogues and representation of Ramayan when it released. While Pathaan took the fifth spot, the divisive The Kerala Story came next with Rajinikanthâ€™s Jailer, Vijayâ€™s Leo and Varisu, and Salman Khanâ€™s Tiger 3 also finding a place on the list. In top trending searches in India for shows, the top three ranks were taken by Shahid Kapoor-starrer Farzi, Wednesday and Arshad Warsi-fronted Asur. Other web shows on the list included Rana Naidu, The Last of Us, Scam 2003, Bigg Boss 17, Guns and Gulaabs, Sex/Life and Taaza Khabar.

The Pritam song, written by Amitabh Bhattacharya and sung by Arijit Singh, made it to the rank 2 spot in songs people hummed to search globally.

Hombale Filmsâ€™ Salaar: Part 1: Ceasefire also stars Prithviraj Sukumaran, Shruti Haasan, and Jagapathi Babu. On Sunday, Prithviraj took to social media and announced the completion of dubbing in all five languages on social media. Prithviraj informed his fans that he has completed dubbing.
Sharing a photo of himself, the actor wrote, â€œ#Salaar Final dubbing corrections done. I have had the privilege of lending my own voice for all my characters across various languages Iâ€™ve worked in over the years. I have even dubbed for some of my characters in multiple languages. But to be dubbing for the same character, in the same film in 5 different languages is a first for me. Telugu, Kannada, Tamil, Hindi and of course Malayalam. And what a film to do it for! Deva and Varadha will meet you in theatres across the world on the 22nd of December 2023! ðŸ”¥.â€

As reported earlier, Salaar will release in two parts and the first part is titled Salaar: Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire. While Prabhas will be seen in the lead role, Prithviraj Sukumaran will essay the role of Varadharaja Mannar. Jagapathi Babu will be seen as Rajamannar, Prithvirajâ€™s father, while Shruti Haasan will be seen as Aadya.
Backed by Hombale Films, Salaar is reportedly made on a budget of Rs 400 crore and is produced by Vijay Kiragandur."
"The trailer of Salaar, starring Prabhas in the lead role, was released on Friday. Directed by Prashanth Neel of KGF fame, the film is less than a month away from its release. It also stars Malayalam star Prithviraj, Shruti Haasan, Jagapati Babu, Eshwari Rao, and Sriya Reddy.
In the 3-minute and 46-second-long trailer, we are given a glimpse of the city of Khansaar which is ruled by some dreaded crime lords. Jagapthi announces his wish of seeing his son Varadha Raja Mannar, played by Prithviraj, as the â€˜lordâ€™ of the city. But he has several enemies working against his wish. This is when Prabhas aka Deva enters the scene. Though he is accompanied by his army, the visuals of the trailer suggest he is the one-man army who can one-up the enemies.
Going by the trailer, Salaar promises to be as action-packed and bloody as director Prashanth Neelâ€™s previous outings, KGF: Chapter 2 and KGF: Chapter 1.

Salaarâ€™s teaser released in July and at the time, fans wondered if Salaar was in the same universe as KGF. Director Prashanth Neel has previously directed the KGF movies, starring Yash, which have been extremely successful all over the country. In fact, KGF Chapter 2, released in 2022, made over Rs 1200 crore at the worldwide box office and emerged as one of the highest grossing Indian films of all time.
This time around, Prashantâ€™s film is going against Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Dunki, directed by Rajkumar Hirani. Shah Rukh has had a stellar year at the movies and his films, Pathaan and Jawan, have collectively made over Rs 2000 crore at the global box office. Speaking about this clash, Prashnath had earlier told The Times of India that this was a â€œvery unpleasant situationâ€.
For Prabhas, who is leading Salaar, this film will be a big test as he just faced a massive failure with Adipurush, where he played the lead role. In fact, his last two releases â€“ Radhe Shyam and Saaho â€“ also failed to impress the audience. Prabhasâ€™ last big hit at the theatres was 2017â€™s Baahubali 2: The Conclusion. After Salaar, Prabhas will be seen in Nag Ashwinâ€™s Kalki 2898 AD and Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Spirit.
Salaar releases in theatres on December 22."
"Actor-producer Arbaaz Khan and his model-actor girlfriend Giorgia Andriani have parted ways after dating each other for several years. Giorgia confirmed their breakup during a recent interview but also mentioned that she will always have feelings for Arbaaz.
While interacting with Pinkvilla, Girogia said that she and Arbaaz always knew their relationship wouldnâ€™t last forever. Calling him her â€˜best friendâ€™, Giorgia said, â€œI will always have feelings for him. The relationship that he had with Malaika did not really come in the way of my relationship with him. What I am nowâ€¦ to be called somebodyâ€™s girlfriend, I definitely find it very demeaning. We both knew it wouldnâ€™t have lasted forever because we were very different.â€

"Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga and Telugu star Nani came together for an interesting conversation about their respective films Animal and Hi Nanna. While Sandeepâ€™s film is about a toxic relationship between a father and son, Naniâ€™s upcoming movie promises to be a moving tale about a single father and his daughter, who yearns for a motherâ€™s love. The common factor in both films is that they are about fathers, and that brought Sandeep and Nani together for a conversation with iDream Media. 
During the interaction, Sandeep shared an interesting story about how he wanted to cast Nani as his hero in a soft romantic film. Sandeep was right out of film school and was looking for a direction opportunity. He got a chance to narrate a script to a producer. The filmmaker said, â€œI want to share one thing with you. In 2010-2011, I was out of film school and was working as an AD in a film. Then one producer asked me to tell a story. That time, I had seen one of your films called Ride. I have worked with theatre artists at film school and I have some experience. So, when I saw the film I was impressed by your modulation. I hadnâ€™t seen your first film Ashta Chamma then. So, I was like, â€˜Who is this guyâ€¦ he has the modulation of a mass heroâ€¦ has great expressions.â€™ So, I had this love story, I still have it. It is a nice soft love story. I narrated the story to the producer.â€"

"Kauravar (1992) is arguably one of the finest gangster films in Malayalam cinema. But, what sets it apart is its compelling second half, where the narrative takes a turn, and the previously bloodthirsty gangster starts protecting the family of the man he initially sought to eliminate for ruining his life and the lives of his aides. The emotional depth conveyed in the story, crafted by AK Lohithadas, is executed with such mastery that Kauravar stands as a timeless classic, a testament to Joshiyâ€™s filmmaking prowess. While navigating a complex narrative that intertwines elements of action and a father-daughter(s) tale, Joshiy ensured that every detail in the script seamlessly translated into the visual language.
Similarly, at its core, Joshiyâ€™s latest film Antony too combines elements of action and a â€˜father-daughterâ€™ tale. But, did he succeed in creating another brilliant film this time? Letâ€™s see.
Also Read | Animal movie review: Ranbir Kapoor, Anil Kapoor wasted in this pointless, vile tale
ADVERTISEMENT
Set in a fictional place called Avaran City, the film revolves around the cold-blooded Antony Anthrapper (Joju George), the uncrowned king of the locality. But, what distinguishes him is his refusal to wield weapons for unjust causes. Despite being strong and remarkably courageous, he typically gets involved only in issues concerning others, especially the underprivileged, or when the ones who need to be taken on are exceptionally wicked. In the latter situations, he charges a substantial fee for his services.
The movie begins with Antony severing a rivalâ€™s leg, leading to the latterâ€™s (unexpected) death and Antonyâ€™s subsequent six-month imprisonment. Upon his release, Antony reaches a settlement with the deceasedâ€™s wife Jessy (Asha Sharath), who had witnessed the incident, by paying her a significant sum. She is also relieved that her criminal spouse is dead. Meanwhile, Jessy is brutally murdered by her husbandâ€™s associates, leaving her daughter Ann Maria (Kalyani Priyadarshan) alone. As per the instructions of the local church priest and friend Fr Paul (Chemban Vinod Jose) and his godfather Avaran (Vijayaraghavan), Antony takes on the responsibility of looking after Ann. A firebrand boxer, Ann is a perpetual â€œproblem-makerâ€ at her college, for which Antony is now answerable, being her local guardian. Their inability to communicate with each other further complicates the situation. The remainder of the film unfolds as it delves into their challenging journey, while Antonyâ€™s enemies gear up to put him to rest.
Watch Antony trailer here:
Despite having a plot that is bound to captivate Malayali audiences, Antony falls flat pretty much from the start due to sloppy writing. Although the film has moments that could be impactful and/or stir a range of emotions, Rajesh Varmaâ€™s narrative remains mostly average. Even those moments, including massy and emotional ones, that are crucial for the film, fall short of evoking the necessary emotions due to the writing lacking depth. Even in the first act, where various characters are introduced, their veracity is lost owing to mediocre writing, and the makersâ€™ attempt to compensate for this by using dialogues has in no way proven helpful. The character of Antony, too, doesnâ€™t receive much depth in this portion, as the scriptâ€™s sole focus is on repeatedly emphasising his lack of inhibitions.
As the story progresses, promising moments emerge, yet Rajesh Varma fails to effectively capitalise on any of them, leaving the overall narrative half-baked. This is especially noticeable when it comes to the antagonists. Despite the film introducing several villains and giving them extensive build-up, complete with slow-motion shots, BGM and sufficient motives to take down Antony, their characters fade away towards the end and the climax wraps up swiftly, leaving one to question why the villains received so much hype throughout the movie.

Amid the flaws in the writing, the film is somewhat saved by director Joshiyâ€™s execution. While Antony may not stand out as one of Joshiyâ€™s good works, let alone the best, his skill in the craft shines through. Right from the initial shot, the director ensures that his distinctive style is prominently displayed. Joshiyâ€™s adept use of actors, focusing on their unique strengths, proves beneficial in Antony as well, particularly in the mass and action sequences. With Antony embodying both good and evil, Joshiy creates a visual space for Joju to bring out the characterâ€™s ethos in an honest manner. Simultaneously, the filmmaker also ensures that Ann Mariaâ€™s character isnâ€™t merely depicted as someone living under Antonyâ€™s protection, giving her genuine agency and exhilarating moments. Despite these merits, the absence of compelling moments diminishes the impact of Joshiyâ€™s efforts.
Though Joju George once again takes on a role that blends both good and evil with various shades of grey, giving the impression that heâ€™s getting typecast, he delivers a strong performance nevertheless. Despite the character bearing similarities to his role in Joshiyâ€™s Porinju Mariam Jose (2019), Joju ensures that Antony remains distinct, maintaining authenticity. His compelling on-screen rapport with Chemban Vinod Jose, who also delivers a commendable performance, adds warmth to the film. Despite an underdeveloped and poorly written character, Nyla Usha remains sincere in her portrayal of Maya, a home nurse; while Vijayaraghavan, as expected, excels in his role.

On the other hand, Kalyani Priyadarshan brings a refreshing performance here. While Ann Maria doesnâ€™t fit the typical â€œcute girl-next-doorâ€ mould, Kalyani too ensures the character isnâ€™t bubbly, a departure from her recent roles. She skillfully handles the action sequences as well, including those in the boxing ring, making them appear authentic.
While Renadive and Shyam Sasidharan perform decently well in their roles as cinematographer and editor, respectively, Jakes Bejoy, who won many hearts this year for several impressive tracks, falls short of expectations with the music in Antony.

"Janhvi Kapoor loves to spend time with her father Boney Kapoor and sister Khushi Kapoor and in a recent video, Janhvi gave a tour of her lavish house in Mumbai to her fans. The house has a huge outdoor space for parties and the interiors look rather impeccable in white. Janhvi recalled that for her, a house means the smell of mogras, AR Rahmanâ€™s music and lots of laughter as those are her memories from the time when her mother Sridevi was still around. Sridevi passed away in 2018.
Janhvi recalled that their evenings would be spent with her father Boney Kapoor trying to impress Sridevi and her â€œtrying to pretend and saying â€˜Oh, stop itâ€™.â€ â€œA lot of our memories were centered around their romance in a way,â€ she recalled. As Janhvi gave a tour of her house, the actor said, â€œFor a long time after mom passed, we wouldnâ€™t sit together as a family because it would just remind us of this gaping vacuum.â€

"Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Jawan emerged as the biggest hit of the year and for child actor Seeza Saroj Mehta, who played Nayantharaâ€™s daughter Suji in the film, this was her first experience with the movies. In a recent interbiew, Seeza shared that she did not even know who Shah Rukh Khan was when she started working in the film.
â€œI got scared on the first day of the shoot as I didnâ€™t know where and how Shah Rukh uncle would come, and when I looked back, he was standing there. He asked my name and asked, â€˜Do you know me?â€™ I said no,â€ she told Hindustan Times. The eight-year-old recalled that she wanted to get a tour of SRKâ€™s vanity van and the actor happily gave her one, also presented her with a chocolate. She shared, â€œI asked Shah Rukh uncle, â€˜Can I see his vanity from inside?â€™ So he took me inside and offered me chocolate. I asked my mom if I could take it, and then took it from him.â€ She recalled that whenever she gave a good performance, director Atlee would give her chocolates as well.

"The third film in Salman Khanâ€™s Tiger franchise, Tiger 3 has been running in the cinema halls for nineteen days and is now giving way to the new releases â€” Animal and Sam Bahadur. On Thursday, the filmâ€™s collection dropped below Rs 2 crore mark. As per industry tracker Sacnilk, it earned Rs 1.85 crore on its 19th day, bringing the total domestic collection to Rs 279.90 crore.
The chances of the film entering the Rs 300 crore club look weak as moviegoers have more options with the release of Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s Animal and Vicky Kaushalâ€™s Sam Bahadur. Worldwide, the film has earned Rs 463 crore. Now if it will achieve the benchmark of Rs 500 crore will be known in the coming week.

"Ever since Rashmika Mandanna called off her engagement with Kannada star Rakshit Shetty and pursued her acting career that transcended Kannada borders, she has been receiving criticism for letting down her home industry. After the success of Geetha Govindam, Rashmika did more projects in other languages than in Kannada thereby receiving backlash from fans of Kannada cinema. It is said that thereâ€™s an ongoing feud between Rishab Shetty (who directed Rashmika in her debut film Kirk Party) and the Animal actor for the same reason. Now, a recent statement from Rishab was also perceived to be an indirect dig at Rashmika. However, Rishab has come out with a tweet to deny such allegations.
At a IFFI 2023 press conference held last week, Rishab said that he didnâ€™t want to be the person who leaves the Kannada film industry after giving one hit. It was perceived as a dig at Rashmika, and an X user pointed out the same in a tweet. However, the fan faced severe backlash for misconstruing Rishabâ€™s statement. He later corrected himself and apologised for twisting Rishabâ€™s opinion."

"Bigg Boss is currently in its 17th season on television and while the show has a dedicated fan base but even after so many years, fans canâ€™t comprehend that the voice artists involved in the show donâ€™t decide who stays in the house. Vijay Vikram Singh, who is the narrator of the show and interacts with the audience, recently spoke to Bollywood Bubble and shared that in the last two years, he has faced many threats for him and his family after a popular contestant gets evicted. Vijay said that he is the second voice on the show, and not the one who interacts with the housemates.
â€œI have to tell people that there are two voices on Bigg Boss, they donâ€™t believe me. I am the voice who interacts with the audience,â€ he said and clarified that his voice is the one that announces the time, and narrates the events to the television audience. â€œThe voice that interacts with the contestants is a different voice. I keep telling people that I am the narratorâ€™s voice on the show,â€ he said.

"Annapoorni, a film about an aspiring chef with an incredible sense of taste and smell, doesnâ€™t feature a single scene that makes one crave food. That could be because the focus is too much on Annapoorni (Nayanthara) and not her subject of obsession or the script. Amidst testosterone-heavy films that leave no room for any other, Nayantharaâ€™s ascent as a â€˜Lady Superstarâ€™ with her own market is commendable, but it becomes a wasted opportunity when the actress also aims to ape â€˜heroismâ€™. Annapporni doesnâ€™t feature Nayanthara sending off goons up in the air, but it does exalt its heroine and pitches her as the symbol of empowerment. Like our heroes, she gets an exaggerated and comical villain, who goes, â€˜I love explosives,â€™ while playing a violent video game. These are the tropes that make our heroes redundant. Are these now prerequisites for â€˜Lady Superstarsâ€™ too?

Director Nilesh Krishnaa has set his film in Sri Rangam, Trichirapalli, a temple town thatâ€™s called Bhoologa Vaikuntam (Heaven on Earth). Annapoorni is the daughter of the head cook in Sri Ranganathar Temple. Her father forsakes a promising career in Railways as an engineer because he considers serving Rangan (God) to be noble. Undoubtedly, he is great at making delicacies for the lord. Annapoorni grows up taking a lot of pride in her father and his cooking skills. On top of that, she has an enhanced sense of taste and smell that she can identify all the ingredients of a complex dish with her eyes blindfolded. All this makes her want to be a chef. While her orthodox Hindu family wants her to pursue an MBA, with some nudging from her childhood friend Farhan (Jai), she joins a catering course and pretends to her family that she is a management student at the same institution. Eventually, the truth comes out and she has to run away from Sri Rangam, calling off a forced wedding to pursue her ambition."
"Shah Rukh Khan on Friday â€˜droppedâ€™ the third piece of promotional material for his new film, Dunki. Fans have already seen a teaser for the movie, followed by a peppy number titled â€œLutt Putt Gaya.â€ And now, they can soak in the sentimentality of Sonu Nigamâ€™s vocals with the filmâ€™s second song, titled â€œNikle The Kabhi Hum Ghar Se.â€ Sonu Nigam, once the foremost playback singers in Bollywood in the â€™90s, became more selective in recent years, but has been slowly making a comeback to the mainstream, with numbers in films such as Laal Singh Chaddha, Shehzada and now Dunki.
The filmâ€™s soundtrack has been composed by Pritam. Lyrics for â€œNikle The Kabhi Hum Ghar Seâ€ have been penned by Javed Akhtar, and the song was first heard in the filmâ€™s teaser. It speaks about the journey that Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s character and his friends go on in the film. Dunki tackles the subject of the mass migration of Indian youth to countries such as Canada and England. According to the press notes, the song adds â€œanother layer of emotionâ€ to the film, about the â€œheart-warming tale of four friends and their quest to reach foreign shores.â€ The song delves into the profound ache of yearning for oneâ€™s homeland, a sentiment that resonates deep within the hearts of those separated from their roots in pursuit of a brighter future.

"Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga appeared to be in no mood to discuss the criticisms leveled against his last film, Kabir Singh, as he prepares to deliver the biggest hit of his short career with Animal, starring Ranbir Kapoor. Kabir Singh divided audiences, with a section of viewers calling out its glorification of toxic masculinity. But it emerged as a massive hit, grossing nearly Rs 400 crore worldwide.
In an interview with CNN-News18, Vanga was asked about a non-consensual kiss between Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advaniâ€™s characters in that film, and said that he doesnâ€™t take the controversy around it â€˜seriouslyâ€™. â€œI didnâ€™t think much about it. I donâ€™t think that Kabir Singh was a misogynistic film. Only four-five people felt offended, and created noise about it. I never took them seriously,â€ he said.

When he was told that it was more than just a handful of people who found fault with the film, Vanga added, â€œFour people wrote articles about it, and that inspired others to write more articles. Not more than 20 people in total, it was their point-of-view. We should not talk about all that, bhool jao Kabir Singh ko (forget Kabir Singh).â€
ADVERTISEMENT
Both Shahid and Kiara have also defended Kabir Singh against criticism. In a chat with mid-day, Shahid called the movie â€˜a dysfunctional love story between a very simple girl and a very talented, brilliant, aggressive disturbed, guyâ€™. Kiara told Bollywood Hungama, â€œMy opinion has always been very clear and for me deep down itâ€™s a love story and the thing about love is that itâ€™s the only thing that will allow you to forgive certain behaviours in life. Relationships are very complex and itâ€™s very easy for a third person to say â€˜get out of that relationshipâ€™. But for two people in that relationship, it is another complication altogether.â€
A kiss between Ranbir Kapoor and Rashmika Mandannaâ€™s characters in Animal, which seemed like Vangaâ€™s answer to the Kabir Singh controversy, also generated conversation. The characters kiss each other as a sign of protest against their families, who disapprove of their relationship. Animal is expected to deliver massive numbers at the box office, and is currently aiming for more than Rs 100 crore globally on day one of release.

"While Bollywood has experienced a comeback this year, with a streak of successful films at the box office, there has been chatter around the veracity of the numbers that are often floated by production houses. Karan Johar touched on the issue in a recent episode of Koffee with Karan, making a reference to comments by Gadar 2 director Anil Sharma. And now, producer Bhushan Kumar has weighed in on the topic, explaining how someone could get away with inflating box office numbers.
In an interview with CNN-News18, the T-Series head honcho said that everything he knows about this subject is based on hearsay, but noted that corporate bookings are the key factor in inflated box office figures. â€œI canâ€™t speak for others, but I donâ€™t believe in this, itâ€™s made-up,â€ he said.

"Itâ€™s no surprise that Sandeep Reddy Vanga, having made movies revolving around boys and their toys has come up with a similar central character, saddled this time around with serious daddy issues. What is surprising, however, is just how â€˜Animalâ€™ ricochets off target after having raced full-tilt to the mid-point: if it had come to an end at the interval, it would have made its point.
But no, we are made to sit through the same loops all the way through 201 minutes, during which one point, and only one is hammered home: if Vijay Singh (Ranbir Kapoor) had got the attention of his always busy papa Balbir (Anil Kapoor), he wouldnâ€™t have taken refuge in bestiality."
"Actor Shalini Pandey comes from a non-filmy family in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, but always harboured the dreams of being an actor.

Arjun Reddy and Kabir Singh are directed by Sandeep Vanga Reddy, the same director whose hyperviolent film Animal has just released in theatres.

"Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga, who is on the cusp of delivering the biggest hit of his career with the Ranbir Kapoor-starrer Animal, looked back on his experience working on Kabir Singh, especially when it came to that filmâ€™s music. After being urged by producer Bhushan Kumar to add certain songs to that film, Vanga assured him that heâ€™ll handle the music of Animal himself, and even offered to redo all of it if it doesnâ€™t work.
In an interview with CNN-News18, T-Series chief Bhushan Kumar praised Vanga for being a great collaborator. â€œHe made great music this time. Normally, I being a music producer, get involved in the music. In Kabir Singh, I was behind him to add a few songs, and he gracefully added them. But this time, the arrangement was that he will make the music as per the film, which will work outside the film also. He clearly told me, â€˜Sir, let me make the music as per the film, if you donâ€™t like it, Iâ€™ll make another songâ€™,â€ the producer said, adding that he couldnâ€™t find fault with Animalâ€™s soundtrack.

"The long form of storytelling has found acceptance in India and in the last few years, the web series space has seen an increase in the number of takers. While the Indian web series space started coming into its own a few years ago, the pandemic saw a growth here as people stayed indoors for a long period of time and streaming platforms became their primary source of entertainment. In 2023, shows like Farzi and Guns and Gulaabs generated a lot of conversation online and as per IMDb, these two hold the top two spots of â€˜Top 10 Most Popular Indian Web Series of 2023.â€™
Farzi marked the digital debut of Shahid Kapoor and also starred Vijay Sethupathi. It is followed by Netflixâ€™s Guns & Gulaabs. Both series were created by Raj & DK. The third spot was held by Aditya Roy Kapur and Anil Kapoor-starrer The Night Manager, which was an adaptation of the British series of the same name and released in two parts on Disney+ Hotstar. The fourth spot was held by the critically acclaimed Netflix series Kohrra, which starred Suvinder Vicky and Barun Sobti.

The fifth and sixth spots were held by Vootâ€™s Asur 2 and Netflix Rana Naidu. Rana Daggubati and Venkatesh-starrer show is now in the process of making its second season. Sonakshi Sinha and Vijay Varma-starrer Dahaad landed the seventh spot, followed by Dimple Kapadia-led Saas Bahu Aur Flamingo. The last two spots were scored by Hansal Mehtaâ€™s Scoop and Vikramaditya Motwaneâ€™s Jubilee.
The second season of Made in Heaven, which managed to make some noise online, has not landed a spot on this list. Even Kajol starrer The Trial, which was heavily promoted by the streaming platform, did not make it to the list. Scam 2003, which was the sequel of the much popular Scam 1992 couldnâ€™t manage to generate any chatter online and was missing from the list as well."
"The year 2023 is coming to an end and unlike the last few years, which did not see many Indian films working at the box office, this became the year when the audience was back in theatres after the pandemic. In 2020, when the theatres shut down due to Covid-19, movies started releasing directly on streaming platforms but after a few dull years at the box office, 2023 saw multiple big hits with Jawan and Pathaan creating history for Indian cinema.
As per IMDb, the list of â€˜Top 10 Most Popular Indian Movies of 2023 (Theatrical)â€™ is led by Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Jawan, which released in September, and has emerged as the biggest grosser of the year. Pathaan, which was the first big hit of the year, also starring SRK is the second on this list, followed by Karan Joharâ€™s Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, starring Alia Bhatt and Ranveer Singh.

"Ranbir Kapoor is all set to deliver the biggest opener of his career with director Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Animal, which debuted in theatres on Friday to enthusiastic response from fans. The film is set to exceed all expectations on its first day of release, and according to industry tracker Sacnilk, it will deliver Rs 65 crore from India alone. Sacnilk is also predicting a global opening of more than Rs 100 crore, making it the third Bollywood film of the year to pass the coveted milestone on day one. Morning shows and afternoon shows on day one reported 46% and 54% occupancy.
Animal delivered one of the biggest pre-sales in the history of Indian films. The action-thriller sold nearly 5 lakh tickets prior to release day, finishing at the fifth spot on the all-time list after Baahubali 2, Jawan, Pathaan, and KGF: Chapter 2. The movie is also delivering tremendous numbers in the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana regions, a sign of how strong Vangaâ€™s fanbase is. Ranbirâ€™s previous top opener was last yearâ€™s Brahmastra, which earned Rs 36 crore in India on day one of release. His 2018 film Sanju collected Rs 34 crore on opening day, and went on to become his biggest hit, grossing nearly Rs 600 crore worldwide.

"Warner Bros has debuted the trailer for the upcoming Mad Max: Fury Road prequel film, whose title has now been revealed as Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga. Starring Anya Taylor-Joy in the central role of a young female warrior who is abducted by an evil warlord in a post-apocalyptic world, the film serves as the origin story of Furiosa, who was first introduced in 2015â€™s Mad Max: Fury Road, in which she was played by Charlize Theron.
The trailer doesnâ€™t reveal too much about the plot, but shows audiences how Furiosa was abducted by a character named Warlord Dementus, played by Chris Hemsworth under thick prosthetic makeup. The trailer also reveals that Fury Road villain Immortan Joe will make an appearance. But large portions of it are devoted to Hemsworthâ€™s colourful performance, and the equally lavish visuals that director George Miller has created.

While the trailer doesnâ€™t reveal too much action, which has always been the highlight of the Mad Max movies, it does promise a layered central performance by Taylor-Joy, whose star has been on the rise ever since she headlined the acclaimed Netflix series The Queenâ€™s Gambit. Furiosa was written even before Fury Road, which served as the fourth film in the long-running action series, originally led by Mel Gibson.
Each movie in the franchise has been directed by Miller, who famously faced several setbacks while making Fury Road in Africa a decade ago. The film was marked by a difficult production, which saw stars Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron butting heads while dealing with a chaotic production in the desert. It was nominated for 10 Oscars and is frequently cited as one of the greatest action films ever made, but was declared a commercial underperformer despite delivering the best box office haul in the franchiseâ€™s history. Furiosa will be released in theatres in May 2024.

Vicky, who is promoting his latest film Sam Bahadur at the moment, was recently asked by a fan as to how his life changed after getting married and Vicky had the most adorable answer.
At an event hosted by Pinkvilla, Vicky said that he loves to hear Katrina talk and shared, â€œI was a good listener before but now Iâ€™ve become an unbeatable listener. I can listen to so much because she loves to talk and I love to hear her talk.â€ He also said that he has to think multiple times before shaving because Katrina hates his clean-shaven look.

"Former actor Imran Khan, who recently returned to public life after spending several years under the radar, spoke about his career in a new interview. Imran remains best known for the romantic comedy Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na and the edgy crime comedy Delhi Belly, and looked back on both movies fondly. But he also didnâ€™t sugarcoat his feelings about the film Luck, even as he admitted that he has gained a new perspective on the movie because of how others view it.
In an interview on the IFP YouTube channel, Imran said that he recently rewatched his past work, and was surprised to observe how progressive and actively non-toxic Jaane Tu and Break Ke Baad were. But he didnâ€™t have too many kind things to say about Luck, which was released in 2009. He said that his resurgence began with an Instagram post about the film, and that he didnâ€™t expect to get the kind of response that he did.

"Shah Rukh Khan has been in the movies for over 30 years now and has been a star for a majority of that time. Despite being one of the biggest superstars of Indian cinema, and having all the perks that come with such stardom, SRK makes sure that he always comes across as humble. Recently, when the star had to take a flight out of the country, he held out his passport in his hand, showed it to the airport security as he chatted with the officer on duty, and patiently waited as the man in-charge checked all the details.
SRK was surrounded by fans and photographers at the airport and was traveling with an entourage which made sure that he wouldnâ€™t get mobbed. As fans watched this video on social media, one of them said, â€œIt is good that Shah Rukh Khan is waiting patiently as he is just an ordinary citizen at the airport. Such behavior also shows how grounded King Khan is.â€ Another fan wrote, â€œHeâ€™s a king who respects protocol n never breaks rules. Just out of the world.â€

"The Red Sea Film Festival kicked off its third edition this week, with a slew of international and Arab stars in attendance. Indiaâ€™s own Ranveer Singh was presented with the The Red Sea: Honoree Award by none other than Sharon Stone, who described him as â€˜an all-round creative geniusâ€™. In his acceptance speech, Ranveer made the rather controversial political choice to vocally voice his admiration for Johnny Depp, who was also in the audience.
â€œI had the exciting pleasure of meeting Ranveer before, what a great guy. It gives me genuine, great pleasure to welcome him to the stage to receive yet another prestigious award,â€ the Basic Instinct star said in her remarks. Ranveer seemed flattered, as he went up to accept the award. In his speech, he gestured towards Depp, and said, â€œI want to go off-script for a moment here. One of my screen idols is in the house, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Johnny Depp. My good sir, Iâ€™ve followed your work since Edward Scissorhands and Whatâ€™s Eating Gilbert Grape. What an honour to be receiving this in your presence. Thank you for everything that youâ€™ve unknowingly taught me about the craft, sir. Master of transformation, versatility, something that inspired by you.â€

"Helmed by Reginald Hudlin, the journeyman director behind stoner comedies and serious biopics, Candy Cane Lane is what happens when the content funnel needs feeding but nobody volunteers to get their hands dirty. In moments like this, streamers tend to turn towards folks that donâ€™t have a choice. Thereâ€™s theoretically nothing wrong with producing movies like this; the algorithm will be satisfied, and subscribers will be duped (yet again). And in a matter of days, weâ€™ll all pretend like this never happened. Everyone will get away, scot -free.
Candy Cane Lane is supposedly a Christmas comedy, but with zero laughs and a charmless central performance by Eddie Murphy, it fails to clear even the low bar that the genre has set for itself. The former megastar plays a middle-aged family man named Chris Carver, who looks forward every year to compete in a neighbourhood contest for the best-decorated house during the holiday season. His wife and three children are only mildly invested in this annual exercise, but entertain his enthusiasm because theyâ€™re nice people. In fact, the movie is so desperate to win the audienceâ€™s affection that it takes several short cuts before setting the plot in motion. Which is perhaps why Chris is fired from his job within 10 minutes.

"Katrina Kaif on Thursday posted a long note appreciating her actor husband Vicky Kaushalâ€™s latest film Sam Bahadur. Katrina called the biographical war drama, set to open in cinemas on December 1, a â€œpoeticâ€ film.
In Meghna Gulzarâ€™s Sam Bahadur, Vicky features as Indiaâ€™s first field marshal, Sam Manekshaw. Katrina, who watched the film at an industry screening, said Sam Bahadur â€œtransportedâ€ her to a different â€œeraâ€ and lauded Vickyâ€™s â€œflawlessâ€ performance.

"Vicky Kaushalâ€™s Sam Bahadur Movie Review: Thereâ€™s a point in the film when Sam Bahadur is striding away from his low-on-morale-soldiers, having delivered a rousing address. One of them looks at his departing back and says: â€˜weâ€™ve finally got someone to tell us what to doâ€™. Thereâ€™s not just admiration in his tone, thereâ€™s reverence in his eyes.
Sam Manekshawâ€™s colourful personality and dazzling career has long been begging for a biopic. Meghna Gulzarâ€™s 150-minute film, which focuses on the high points of his personal and professional life, is as admiring and reverential as that soldier who comes on for a moment and then bows out, his job done. Some individuals easily lend themselves to admiring bio-pics, and Sam Bahadurâ€™s fans were, and still are, legion. But the film suffers from being excessively declamatory, with the background music overpowering the momentous events and the towering individuals on screen: the only one who escapes this, and keeps standing tall right through the film is Vicky Kaushal In and As Mankeshaw. This is Kaushalâ€™s most challenging role, and he plays it to perfection.

He told indianexpress.com, â€œExpectations are mammoth from Animal. Ranbir Kapoor has a penchant for starting big on non-holidays, which others canâ€™t do even on holidays, so thatâ€™s clearly up his sleeve. Animal is a brilliant presentation and people are keenly looking forward to it. Despite the adult certificate, non-holiday release and its longer duration, the film is set to have a massive opening, not only in India but also in overseas markets.â€
If Animal performs well at the ticket counters, it will be Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s second hit in a row after Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar.

In the rapid-fire round, Rani gave some fiery answers to Karanâ€™s questions. When Karan asked her who would she have enjoyed sharing the couch with if not Kajol, she responded, â€œI think my husband (Aditya Chopra) because I know heâ€™d never come.â€
When Rani was asked who she had better chemistry with â€” Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Saif Ali Khan or Aamir Khan, the actor said she had a better chemistry with SRK.

At the beginning of the episode, Rani and Kajol had shared that they were never close to each other during their younger days. But there was no specific reason as to why they didnâ€™t interact with each other despite being cousins. However, Rani mentioned that she was closer to Kajolâ€™s sister Tanisha and Kajol shared a better equation with the boys of their family. Kajol and Rani got closer after the death of their fathers.

"The latest episode of Koffee With Karan had the leading ladies of the hit 1998 film Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Kajol and Rani Mukerji gracing the â€˜Koffee couchâ€™. During the episode, the filmâ€™s director and the showâ€™s host, Karan Johar and the two actors spoke at length about the time they spent on the sets of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. Meanwhile, Kajol also shared her thoughts about love and marriage, the two central themes of the film, which also starred Shah Rukh Khan.
During the rapid-fire round of the show, Karan asked Kajol if she believes in the filmâ€™s popular dialogue, â€œPyaar ek baar hota hai, shaadi bhi ek baar hoti hai (You fall in love only once and you get married once).â€ She replied, â€œâ€˜Bilkul nahi. I definitely donâ€™t believe it.â€

But this time, he got a strong reaction from Kajol as she asked him to â€œshut upâ€.
Karan, while revealing how Rani has â€˜firedâ€™ him a couple of times for â€˜apologisingâ€™ for the gender politics of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, also tried to explain that what he showed in the film was not his mindset, but a result of what he had learnt from the Hindi cinema. â€œI learnt from Hindi cinema. So, whatever the film had, it was not me thinking inappropriately. It was just what my mind was trained to be,â€ he said.

The actor, who had previously donned the uniform in the 2019 blockbuster Uri The Surgical Strike, said he has realised with his training with the Indian Army how they function and what doesnâ€™t make the cut for themâ€“ which is their lazy on-screen portrayal.

Billed as a survival adventure based on a â€œtrue storyâ€, Aadujeevitham is helmed by National Award-winning director Blessy and produced by Visual Romance. The film also stars Hollywood actor Jimmy Jean-Louis, Amala Paul, KR Gokul and Arab actors Talib al Balushi and RikAby in pivotal roles."
"Itâ€™s a year of big Bollywood clashes at the box office. After OMG 2 and Gadar 2 had the clash of sequels on August 11, Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s Animal and Vicky Kaushal starrer Sam Bahadur are both releasing in theatres on December 1 st . While Sam Bahadurâ€™s release date was announced a year ago, the makers of Animal chose the same date, raising quite a few eyebrows. Perhaps it was easier to compete with director Meghana Gulzarâ€™s film than taking on Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s film Dunki or Prabhasâ€™ Salaar releasing later in the month.
Unfortunately, badly behaved men have always generated good results at the box office. Perhaps thatâ€™s why, in spite of the A rating and long running time, Animal has had a tremendous response ever since advance bookings opened and is currently miles ahead of Sam Bahadur in terms of projected opening day revenues. As per a post on Sacnilk Entertainmentâ€™s page on X, formerly Twitter dated November 29, approximately 5 lakh tickets of Animal had been sold through advance bookings indicating a possible opening day revenue of Rs 14 crores. Sam Bahadur in the meanwhile had managed to sell about 38,556 tickets indicating an opening day revenue of a little over a crore.

Karan began the interaction with a question about Twinkleâ€™s decision to pursue higher studies as a middle-aged woman, which somehow ended with her joking about Karanâ€™s sexual orientation.
â€œI partly went back to university because I was approaching 50. Age is definitely a mathematical problem, but itâ€™s not a sum of division, where youâ€™re reduced to a fraction of what you are,â€ Twinkle began soberly. Moments later, she was wondering how Karan couldâ€™ve been a â€˜topperâ€™ at anything, because sheâ€™s always thought of him as a â€˜bottomâ€™. She watched him squirm as her joke registered.

"Dia Mirza has been in the entertainment business for over 20 years now. In a recent interview, the actor spoke about the time when she won the Miss Asia-Pacific pageant back in the year 2000. Dia shared that she never allowed anyone to â€œcommodify or objectifyâ€ her and went against the grain when she chose to wear a one-piece swimsuit in the international pageant, which was an unpopular choice. Women participating in international beauty pageants were expected to wear two-piece swimsuits in the swimwear round.
Dia, in a chat with BBC Hindi, said, â€œWhen I participated in the international pageant, I was very uncomfortable wearing a two-piece swimsuit so I wore a one-piece swimsuit. No one before my year, or even after it had done this. It depends on your individual choice. No one can force you to do anything that makes you uncomfortable.â€

"Amitabh Bachchan took to social media to express his happiness as actor-son Abhishek Bachchan and daughter Shweta Bachchan Nandaâ€™s son Agastya Nanda attended the Sam Bahadur screening which took place last night. Big B shared a clip of the two and penned a note.
Sharing a collage of Abhishek and Agastya, Senior Bachchan wrote, â€œà¤°à¤•à¤¼à¥à¤¤ à¤¬à¤¹à¤¤à¤¾ à¤¹à¥ˆ, à¤¦à¥‹à¤¨à¥‹à¤‚ à¤®à¥‡à¤‚ à¤¬à¤šà¥à¤šà¤¨ à¤¹à¥ˆ ; à¤†à¤¶à¥€à¤°à¥à¤µà¤¾à¤¦ à¤¸à¤¦à¤¾ à¤‰à¤¨à¤•à¤¾ à¤¤à¥à¤® à¤¦à¥‹à¤¨à¥‹à¤‚ à¤ªà¥‡ ðŸ™ (Blood flows, both are Bachchans; His blessings always be upon you both).â€

"Ahead of the much-anticipated release of Animal in cinemas this Friday, director Sandeep Reddy Vanga has been actively engaged in the filmâ€™s promotional activities. During interviews, he has been addressing various misconceptions surrounding the film that arose following the trailerâ€™s release nearly a week ago. In one such interview, he addressed the viral scene featuring Rashmika Mandanna, where she is seen speaking to Ranbir Kapoor with clenched teeth.
Post the trailerâ€™s launch, social media buzzed with memes, with some expressing difficulty in comprehending Rashmikaâ€™s dialogue. Explaining the scene, Sandeep told Indiatoday.in, â€œShe was supposed to speak in a particular way because itâ€™s a very emotional scene. I knew there would be a certain reaction to it. When someone is feeling a certain emotion, then they speak with their teeth clenched. I think keeping it in the trailer has only given it multiple views. When you see it as part of the larger scene in the movie, it will make more sense.â€

"Childhood friends Twinkle Khanna and Karan Johar bantered at her book launch event in Mumbai on Wednesday evening, not holding back from throwing sharp jabs at each other. While Karan joked that Twinkle loves listening to the sound of her own voice, Twinkle made fun of his dedication to learning the ways of the Gen Z by hanging out with people half his age. She humorously called him a â€˜vampireâ€™ who â€˜sucks out the bloodâ€™ of young actors.
Karan has admitted many times that he befriends young actors in order to stay relevant. But at the book launch event, Twinkle claimed that Karan told her that he doesnâ€™t want to end up like some â€˜obsoleteâ€™ directors whom he described as â€˜fossilsâ€™. She said, â€œI know that you are a big advocate of the youth, weâ€™ve discussed how you stay relevant.â€ Noticing Karan making a face in anticipation of another joke at his expense, she continued, â€œNo, donâ€™t make that face. Iâ€™m not saying anything bad. You said you were immersing yourself among young people, which is why you love Shanaya, Anaya, Alia and Alayaâ€¦â€ Karan corrected her, and said that heâ€™s actually friends with Ananya, and Twinkle replied, â€œYou know Anayas as well.â€
Also read | Twinkle Khanna says Karan Johar charges â€˜a croreâ€™ to play rapid fire at kidsâ€™ birthday parties, he says: â€˜Your husband and I think alikeâ€™
As Karan made a face again, Twinkle continued, â€œWe had a very long conversation. We were talking about directors we canâ€™t name, but he said that theyâ€™re obsolete, theyâ€™re fossils, he said all these awful things about them. And then he said, â€˜You have to be relevant, thatâ€™s why I hang around with young peopleâ€™. I said, â€˜Yes, but I donâ€™t like people, I canâ€™t hang around with themâ€™.â€
Twinkle admitted that both she and Karan are â€˜fossilsâ€™, because the world that they grew up in no longer exists. Karan has addressed his fascination with the younger generation, many of whom he invites on Koffee with Karan. He also spoke about the sort of clothes he started wearing some years ago, and attributed his loud fashion makeover to a â€˜mid-life crisisâ€™.

"Anil Kapoor, who will soon be seen in Animal with Ranbir Kapoor, recently shared that he always knew that Ranbir is going to be a star and described him as the â€œtall Raj Kapoor.â€ Ranbir made his debut with Anilâ€™s daughter Sonam Kapoor in the 2007 film Saawariya and while the film was panned at the time, Anil said that he always had faith in Ranbirâ€™s talent.
Talking to Connect FM Canada, Anil said, â€œI started my career as a casting director. I have a certain instinct for faces and actors. Iâ€™m very proud of that. I watched Saawariya and I just said â€˜In the Kapoor family, there is a tall Raj Kapoor.â€™ I said it almost 16 years ago.â€

"Twinkle Khanna called her childhood friend, filmmaker Karan Johar, a â€˜leechâ€™ for saying that her marriage with husband Akshay Kumar inspired his film Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani. Karan said that Twinkle shouldnâ€™t take what he says in interviews seriously, and told her that the movie was simply about an unconventional couple. Twinkle, known for her progressive world view, is married to Akshay Kumar, who has displayed right-leaning tendencies in both his personal life and professional output.
At the launch event for her new book, Welcome to Paradise, Karan attempted to interview Twinkle about her life and career, but the conversation quickly became a roast session, with the old friends poking fun at each otherâ€™s eccentricities. â€œYou based Rocky Aur Rani on my marriage, apparently. Thatâ€™s what everyone is saying. Is that true? How much can you leech off me?â€ Twinkle asked. Karan replied, â€œNo, it was just two people from different schools of thought coming together. That doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s your marriage, Tina. Everything is not about you.â€ Twinkle said that she read it on the news, and claimed that Karan had made these comments in an interview. Karan replied, â€œDonâ€™t believe everything I say.â€

When asked what has he learned from Katrina, Vicky told Ranveer Allahbadia, â€œOn the surface level she has added what kind of clothes should I wear because she is like, â€˜Kya joker banke ja raha hai ye (He is walking out dressed like a joker)â€™ She has literally held my hand and pulled me back saying that you will not step out like this. I asked her, â€˜Ismein kya galat hai? (What is wrong in this?)â€™ And she said, â€˜ Sab kuch.â€™ I was like okay.â€

In a chat with Pinkvilla, Sandeep shared, â€œHe (Ranbir) never wanted that. Very clearly, he didnâ€™t want that. He said please donâ€™t do that. But for the poster I convinced him because I said forget about what you are feeling, itâ€™s my feeling. I feel that you are a superstar. I feel like putting that â€˜superstarâ€™ before your name.â€

Karan recalled the time when he had instructed the room service at the hotel to not give any food to Rani so she could lose weight, and her mother was in on this scheme. Karan said that he wanted Rani to wear a particular skirt and believed that it would only work on her if she lost weight.
Rani also recalled that during this time, Karan â€œsnatched food from my handâ€ and later compensated by saying that it was his â€œinnate goodnessâ€ that made him return the plate immediately. Karan recalled, â€œI had to told Rani that she had to wear this short skirt in Mauritius so just lose some weight because you have to wear it. She said Iâ€™ll lose some 4-5 kilos. 4-5 kilos were not lost, they were put on.

"Karan Johar and Twinkle Khanna roasted each other incessantly at the recent launch event for her latest book, Welcome to Paradise. Karan interviewed Twinkle, his childhood friend, about her career as an author, getting a degree in creative writing in her 50s, and various other topics. At one point in the conversation, Twinkle poked fun at Karanâ€™s ability to milk his brand for money by agreeing to attend private events.
Karan embraced this side of himself, and said that heâ€™s a lot like Twinkleâ€™s husband, actor Akshay Kumar, in this regard. Karan asked her, â€œWhat would you prefer, bestselling author, or a critically acclaimed one with no sales at all?â€ Twinkle replied, â€œI want to be Karan Johar with my own show, where I make so much money, and I also go to peopleâ€™s birthday parties and they give me a crore for that.â€ Karan was left speechless.

"Rani Mukerji and Aditya Chopra have maintained a strict â€˜no photographsâ€™ policy for their seven-year-old daughter, Adira Chopra. So much so that no one has even seen any paparazzi shots of Adira, and on the latest episode of Koffee with Karan, Rani explained how she managed this in a world where everyone has a phone in their hands and clicking celebrity kids is not really a difficult task.
Rani shared that immediately after Adira was born, she would request photographers to not click her photos, and they would oblige. â€œI told them â€˜Please, baby ka photo mat lijiye (donâ€™t take the babyâ€™s photo) and from that day, they respected that. To this day, they wait until Adira goes into the airport and then they take my pictures,â€ she said.

"Karan Johar hosted Kajol and Rani Mukerji on this weekâ€™s episode of Koffee with Karan, and while the episode mostly felt like a Kuch Kuch Hota Hai reunion fest, the two actors also spoke about their off-screen relationship over the years. Kajol and Rani are cousins, and Rani made her debut at a time when Kajol was already a popular movie star. On the episode, Karan shared that he would always wonder why the two actors werenâ€™t close to each other, considering they are family. Kajol explained that there was some â€œorganic distanceâ€ between the two.
Karan said that they didnâ€™t share â€œa close friendship or relationship at all,â€ and added that Kajol kept â€œa silent distance from her (Rani).â€ â€œI used to wonder what kind of family is this? Theyâ€™re not even talking to each other. I thought they are cousins, it will all be good,â€ he said. Rani explained that she had known Kajol as a kid, and admitted that the relationship between the two â€œwas a bit strange.â€ â€œShe was always Kajol didi for me,â€ she added. Rani said that it is always a little difficult to decipher why people grow apart as they grow older, and added that even though there was some distance with Kajol, she was, and continues to be, much closer to Kajolâ€™s younger sister Tanisha Mukherjee.

"Ranbir Kapoor and Bobby Deol starrer Animal has dominated headlines ever since its teaser was released and from the way its advance booking is being reported, it seems it is all set to do the same at the box office. Ranbirâ€™s films have had an inconsistent track at the box office of late. After the humungous hit Sanju that re released pre-pandemic, his releases  Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar, Brahmastra and Shamshera received a mixed response from the audience. While Shamshera was panned entirely, Brahmastra pulled in the people but had a bloated budget of Rs 400 crore. Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar brought some relief with its decent earnings. However, the actoris expected to beat box office blues with Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Animal, which is expected to open with Rs 100 crore globally.
Animal, scheduled to hit the theatres on December 1, is an intense crime saga which revolves around the complicated relationship between Arjun Singh (Ranbir) and his industrialist father Balbir Singh (Anil Kapoor). The cast also includes Bobby Deol as Ranbirâ€™s mute nemesis who is enough to tempt the 90s kids to come to the theatres. Rashmika Mandanna, an actor with a good pull in the southern region of the country, plays Ranbirâ€™s submissive wife. The filmâ€™s director Vanga carries weight as well.

"A delicately paced document of urban decay, a loving tribute to human resilience, and a last-minute rescue operation for a film industry drowning in a ditch of mediocrity, director Parth Saurabhâ€™s Pokhar Ke Dunu Paar is the best Hindi movie of the year. Released on Mubi, it tells the story of an eloped couple who return to their hometown of Darbhanga, as they reel from the financial aftershocks of the pandemic and hold on to the last vestiges of romance as practicality rears its ugly head.
Unlike most conventional films, Pokhar Ke Dunu Paar is more interested in the moments after the drama. We never see how Sumit and Priyanka, played by the phenomenal Abhinav Jha and Tanaya Jha Khan, actually made their relationship work, much less how they managed to run away. Nor do we ever cut away to the disgruntled dad who is often mentioned through the course of the filmâ€™s lean, but thematically rich, narrative. Weâ€™re left to exist alongside Sumit and Priyanka, as they reckon with the magnitude of the decision theyâ€™ve made, perhaps having imagined an idyllic life together. Think of it as a feature-length expansion of the memorable final shot of The Graduate, in which Dustin Hoffman and Katharine Ross contemplate an uncertain future after getting married in a moment of mad passion.

"No one portrays grey roles the way megastar Amitabh Bachchan does, says KGF director Prashant Neel, who believes all his leading men carry a bit of the superstarâ€™s anti-hero persona in them.
Neel, who directed the pan-India hit KGF: Chapter 1 in 2018 and followed it up with KGF: Chapter 2 in 2022, is currently promoting Prabhas-starrer Salaar Part 1: Ceasefire that is set to release on December 22. Both the films are produced by Hombale Films.
â€œAmitabh Bachchan is the biggest inspiration for all my movies. There are a lot of movies that he did where he played the hero but he was also the villain. Thatâ€™s a genre that was rarely seen post that period. The way he portrayed the greys, I donâ€™t think anybody else did it,â€ the writer-director told PTI in an interview.

â€œHe made villainy look heroic. So, I try to do that with my moviesâ€¦ I try to make my characters look as negative as possible, even the positive ones. The hero has to be the biggest villain of my movie,â€ he added.
Prashanth Neel said his all time favourite Amitabh Bachchan movie is the 1990 hit Agneepath, a revenge drama directed by Mukul Anand. The director said his dream is to direct the megastar in a movie.
â€œBefore I die, I want to do a movie with Amitabh Bachchan. Being a student of cinema of the 70s, 80s and 90s, I canâ€™t think of anybody else other than him. Itâ€™s my biggest dream to want to make a movie for Amitabh Bachchan. Iâ€™ve to make him the biggest villain of my movie. I would not make it another way. If he agrees to do something, it will be the biggest honour of my life.â€
When asked if he would ever direct a picture in a genre other than action, Neel said he would be thrilled to try something different.

â€œIt becomes monotonous for anybody to do something like that, you want to move away from a genre,â€ he added.

His performances in films like Devdas, Gunga Jumna, Mughal-e-Azam are seen as some of the finest performances in Hindi cinema but while he came across as a poised and elegant man on screen, he was a foodie who loved his spicy food.

Because back in 2016, when I used to go around on a scooty, I used to listen to Bacon a lot. Back then, I used to wonder what if I collaborate with him one day,â€ he told India Folk Project.

"Shah Rukh Khan is loved by millions of people around the country and rapper King, who will soon be collaborating with King Khan, was completely taken by the actorâ€™s humility when SRK asked him for a collaboration. King shared that when he spoke to SRK over a video call, the actor folded his hands and apologised for coming late and then requested him for a song, but only if King feels like it. The â€œMaan Meri Jaanâ€ singer said SRK understands how to work with artists as he gives them the freedom to make whatever they want.
In a chat with India Folk Project, King said, â€œI spoke to him on a video call and I couldnâ€™t sleep for two days just out of excitement.â€ King recalled their conversation and shared, â€œHe came a little late on the call. Honestly, it didnâ€™t matter to me that he was late, he was there and thatâ€™s all that matters. But the first thing he did was, he folded his hands and said, â€˜King, I am so sorry Iâ€™m late.â€™ I was sitting on the sofa and I sat on the floor. I folded my hands and I said, â€˜Sir, please donâ€™t do this.'â€

"Although Malayalam filmmaker Alphonse Puthran took the country by storm with back-to-back hits at the beginning of the 2010s, his recent directorial, Gold, starring Prithviraj Sukumaran and Nayanthara in the lead roles, failed to impress viewers and ended up bombing at the box office.
Meanwhile, he announced last month that he was quitting making films for theatres due to self-diagnosed autism. The post that shocked his fans was, however, later deleted by Puthran himself. While elaborating on his decision, the filmmaker recently slammed theatres in the state for destroying the dreams of many writers.

"In December, two major Hindi films, Sam Bahadur and Animal, are set to clash at the box office early in the month. Closing the month will be a monumental face-off between Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Dunki and Prabhasâ€™ Salaar on December 22. Recently, Prashanth Neel, the writer and director of Salaar, addressed his filmâ€™s clash with Dunki.
Neel, in an interview with The Times Of India, expressed that no filmmaker desires a clash, whether itâ€™s with a newcomerâ€™s film or with a veteran like Shah Rukh Khan. â€œBut it is a very unpleasant situation for anybody to move their date to somebody elseâ€™s date,â€ he said. The director also added that he didnâ€™t want somebody else to move to their filmâ€™s date when they had announced their release date a year ago. He highlighted that their filmâ€™s release date was determined by the production team without his involvement in the decision-making process.

"Director Danny Boyleâ€™s Slumdog Millionaire (2008) marked a significant milestone for nearly everyone associated with it, including composer AR Rahman and sound designer Resul Pookutty, as it secured their first Academy Awards. However, did you know that the central focus of the movie originally wasnâ€™t Jamal Malikâ€™s (Dev Patel) quest to find Latika (Freida Pinto)? Similarly, Rahmanâ€™s Oscar-winning song, â€œJai Hoâ€œ, wasnâ€™t originally intended to be included in the film.
Sound designer Resul Pookutty recently opened up about how the core of the film was reshaped during the editing process, keeping its box office viability in mind, and how Rahman incorporated â€œJai Hoâ€ after filming, originally using a Shankar Ehsaan Loy song on set.

"Salman Khan is basking in the success of his latest, Tiger 3, which is all set to pass the Rs 450 crore mark at the global box office. In a recent roundtable interview, the actor addressed the failure of his films Antim: The Final Truth and Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan. Salman said that if these films had released now, theyâ€™d end up doing â€˜double the businessâ€™. Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan was released only a few months ago, after Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Pathaan had done business of over Rs 1000 crore globally, and Salman had received fresh publicity thanks to his cameo in it.
Salman said, â€œWhen these films were released, people were not going to theatres. Moreover, we didnâ€™t do blockbuster prices, we were going for popular prices. Our box office numbers were lower in those films but we focused on saving the audienceâ€™s money. How much did you watch Tiger 3 at? Rs 600, 1000?â€

"Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga, who is gearing up for the release of his new film Animal, looked back on the difficult process of remaking Arjun Reddy in Hindi as Kabir Singh. He said that he would never do a remake ever again, and revealed that not everybody was in favour of casting Shahid Kapoor in the lead role. The original Arjun Reddy, starring Vijay Deverakonda, emerged as a massive hit, making over Rs 50 crore against a budget of less than Rs 3 crore.
In an interview with iDream Media, the director said that after the film became a blockbuster, he pitched an idea to Mahesh Babu, which he assumed would be his second film. But when the superstar signed another project, Vanga decided to remake the film in Hindi, because heâ€™d been flooded with offers from Bollywood already.

Starring Ranbir Kapoor in the lead role, the film explores the complicated relationship between a father and son. The trailer of the film has intrigued the audience, leaving them excited for it.

"Having already sold over 2 lakh tickets with two full days remaining till release, the Ranbir Kapoor-starrer Animal is headed for one of the biggest pre-sale records in Hindi cinema history. The epic crime saga is expected to sell around 4 and 5 lakh tickets prior to release in just the major national cinema chains, according to Pinkvilla. This would be enough to ensure a spot in the top-five advance sellers ever.
According to industry tracker Sacnilk, Animal has sold tickets worth nearly Rs 14 crore for day one alone, with the majority of the interest coming from the Hindi-speaking belt. However, Animal is also generating massive interest from the Telugu-speaking belt, with over Rs 5 crore of the total coming from there. This is a higher-than-usual figure what what is essentially a Hindi film, and it can be surmised that the combined pull of director Sandeep Reddy Vanga and Rashmika Mandanna is responsible for this. The film will also be released in Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam dubbed versions.

"In the fine tradition of films like War and RRR, whose veiled homoeroticism has inspired cult conspiracy theories and plenty of colourful analysis, Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Animal appears to be aiming for a 5 on the Kinsey scale. The filmâ€™s recently released trailer ends with Lord Bobby Deolâ€™s villain ripping his shirt off and then having a symbolic post-coital smoke literally atop Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s protagonist. Despite not having a single word of dialogue â€” it is, ahem, being said that he will remain silent throughout the film â€” Deolâ€™s antagonist was by far the most interesting thing about a piece of promotion that leaves you with little else than a strong urge to take a shower.
Since his comeback some years ago, the one-time matinee idol has mostly played villains, and a quick glance at his upcoming films suggests that this is the path that he has chosen to stick with. These characters are unidimensional, sleepy-eyed and stone-faced crooks who rarely reveal what theyâ€™re thinking â€” this, in all probability, is mainly down to Deolâ€™s limitations as an actor than how theyâ€™ve been written. But amid a string of subpar projects in the actorâ€™s recent filmography, there lies a gem. Released only last year, director Shanker Ramanâ€™s romantic thriller, Love Hostel, had all the makings of a cult classic, but a hobbled release on ZEE5 made sure that it remains slept-on to this day.

"TELLING THE story of someone as iconic as Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw comes with its set of unique requisites. Meghna Gulzar, co-writer-director of his upcoming biopic Sam Bahadur, chose to always place the camera lower than eye-level of actor Vicky Kaushal, who plays the titular lead, so that â€œit looks up at himâ€. For Kaushal, however, the â€œtoughest taskâ€ was to find Manekshawâ€™s â€œheart and spiritâ€. Gulzar and Kaushal were speaking at the Express Adda in New Delhi on Monday.
Giving a peek into his process of playing Manekshaw, Kaushal said: â€œThe aura that he had was not limited to his uniform. So I have to give it to Meghna, who held my hand through this, because otherwise it was impossible for me to even attempt this.â€

"KE Gnanavel Raja is facing severe backlash from top directors and producers of Tamil film industry for his recent statements against director Ameer. Director-actor Samuthirakani penned a strongly-worded statement hitting out at the Studio Green producer asking him to be careful with his words. Director Sasikumar of Subramaniapuram fame also came out against Gnanavel Raja. Now, veteran filmmaker Bharathiraja has also condemned the producerâ€™s controversial and demeaning statements against Ameer.
Bharathiraja took to social media to share a statement. In the post, Bharathiraja supported Ameer and said Gnanavel Rajaâ€™s statements are condemnable. The statement read, â€œThe issue between you and Ameer is for financial reasons. However, you have spoken about a great creator in a way to cause embarrassment to his art, which is condemnable. Ameerâ€™s contribution in identifying you and making you a successful producer is huge and you shouldnâ€™t forget it. Even before Paruthiveeran, Ameer has directed films and has produced one. To say that he learnt filmmaking with your money with a sly laughter is a disrespect to all creators because a creator will keep learning until death. I am learning even now. In my opinion, you have to apologise and solve the issue for disrespecting a great creator.â€

"Deepika Padukoneâ€™s decision to launch the skincare brand 82 E surprised many, given the abundance of such firms in the market. However, since its inception in 2022, 82 E has managed to carve a niche in that space. As the firm celebrates its first anniversary, it is set to expand its research and development (R&D) capacity.
In an interview with Forbes India, Deepika mentioned that consistency has been the most powerful arrow in the companyâ€™s arsenal. She said, â€œWe first identified a pain point, which was also my own. Why does skincare have to be so complex? Many brands discuss complex routines and ingredients. I was that person who wanted beautiful glowing skin, but I also wanted it to be simple yet effective. Another issue was always having to choose between brands or products based on Ayurveda versus those based on science. So, we brought all of this together, put it into one bottle, and thatâ€™s how 82 EAST came about. In fact, we are now seeing other brands also discussing simplified skincare, and weâ€™re really happy about that.â€

"Actor-director Rishab Shetty has said Kannada cinema is waiting for OTT platforms to open their doors for them.
Talking to reporters on the sidelines of the ongoing International Film Festival of India (IFFI) here on Tuesday, Shetty said Kannada movies used to generate revenue after participating in initiatives like NFDC Film Bazaar.
â€œBut after the COVID19 pandemic and due to OTT platforms, the markets have collapsed. The OTT platforms are refusing to accept Kannada films because one commercial film (from Kannada) backfired,â€ the Kantara actor-director said.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œNow, OTT platforms are saying that they are not open for Kannada films. That is really bad. Just because of one film, you cannot say that there is no market for the film or there are no subscribers,â€ he added.
Rishab Shetty said he has done three films in Kannada, which are doing festival circuits.
â€œOTTs are saying that they will take time to accept Kannada films. We are waiting for their doors to open,â€ he said.
Shetty claimed that if OTT platforms do not open the doors, then these would be the last films that he has done for any festival circuits.

Rishab Shetty received critical acclaim for writing, directing and starring in Kantara, a Kannada period action thriller that was released in 2022.
The movie, which is being screened at IFFI 2023 as part of the international competition, is set in the fictional village of Dakshina Kannada and follows a Kambala champion, played by Shetty, who is at loggerheads with an upright Forest Range officer, Murali.
He is now looking forward to Kantara: Chapter 1, the prequel to the blockbuster hit. The makers unveiled the first look of the movie on Thursday.

Rishab Shetty said filmmakers often talk at length about their movie projects.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œBut for Kantara: Chapter 1, I donâ€™t want to talk, people should talk about it. Our concentration should be on the work,â€ he said.
The actor-director said that his film competing with other international feature films is his â€œmost proud momentâ€ which was possible due to the support that was received for the film.
â€œWe are now producing Kantara: Chapter 1. We released a poster of it and we got a good response for that,â€ he said.
Shetty said that the idea of producing a prequel to Kantara was there during shooting of the original film but the decision was taken after it became a hit.
ADVERTISEMENT
In the entire journey of Kantara, the community performing Kola rituals was with him, he added.
â€œThe film is based on our belief system. My family performs the ritual and we believe in it. I have seen people mocking the ritual by performing it on the stage. The community gets hurt because of that. I request people not to hurt the community,â€ Shetty said.
The actor-director said that he never faced a language barrier for Kantara. â€œWhen content is good then the people accept it,â€ he added.
Post Kantara, Rishab Shetty said he received several offers from non-Kannada filmmakers.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œI was a fan of some of them. But I refused them. I donâ€™t want to leave the Kannada film industry. I am always grateful to the Kannada audience,â€ Shetty said."

"Salman Khan is currently savouring the success of his recent film, Tiger 3. In a candid conversation, the actor expressed strong opinions about the â€˜superstarâ€™ label associated with him. He dismissed such tags as â€˜really stupid and silly,â€™ expressing his discomfort with the title and the pressure that comes with it. Salman also highlighted that he hasnâ€™t experienced failure in the film industry till date and emphasised how even his flop films have been profitable for producers.
Speaking to Pinkvilla, Salman said, â€œI donâ€™t like when they call me â€˜superstarâ€™ â€˜megastar.â€™ That is something I donâ€™t care about.

Mansoor Ali Khanâ€™s controversial comments
At a press meet for the promotion of his upcoming film Sarakku, Mansoor Ali Khan opened up about acting in Vijayâ€™s Leo, which had Trisha in an important role. Though Mansoor and Trisha were part of the film, they didnâ€™t share screen space. Speaking about the same, Mansoor, who has played many antagonist roles, said, â€œWhen I heard Trisha was in the film, I thought I would have a bedroom scene with her. I thought I would carry her to the bedroom like I have done with many actresses in my earlier movies. Rape scenes are not new to me. However, these guys didnâ€™t give me a glimpse of Trisha.â€
The controversial statement led to severe backlash from actors including Chiranjeevi, Khushbu Sundar, Leo director Lokesh Kanagaraj. Nadigar Sangam, the film body for Tamil actors, issued a temporary ban on the actor and demanded an apology. National Commission for Women took suo moto cognizance of Mansoorâ€™s comments about Trisha.

Telugu star Chiranjeevi came out in support of Trisha and tweeted, â€œMy attention was drawn to some reprehensible comments made by actor Mansoor Ali Khan about Trisha. The comments are distasteful and disgusting not just for an artist but for any woman or girl. These comments must be condemned in the strongest words. They reek of perversion. I stand with Trisha and every woman who has to be subject to such horrid comments.â€
Reacting to the same, Mansoor Ali Khan said, â€œChiranjeevi garu is a big star. I have acted with him. He throws a party every year for his yesteryear heroines who acted with him. I have also acted with him, but he never invites me (laughs). He only invites them. It is his matter. But he is such a big actor, he could have called me and asked about my statement. He didnâ€™t.â€
Mansoor Ali Khan was later questioned by Tamil Nadu police, after which the actor released an apology statement.

"Filmmaker Sandeep Reddy Vanga, who courted trouble over his previous Hindi film Kabir Singh, is gearing up for the release of his upcoming movie Animal, featuring Ranbir Kapoor.

Vanga has now expressed that the definition of toxicity varies from person to person and said that it is influenced by individual perspectives on a story and its characters. He said in an interview with The Hindu, â€œI did not face much criticism for Arjun Reddy, but it was different for Kabir Singh. I donâ€™t want to name anyone but I saw a few people debating about Kabir Singh to get publicity before the release of their own films. A leading producer-director said he was scared to admit liking Kabir Singh. People acted as though I had made a film on the lines of the French film Irreversible. That film left me disturbed for days, though I could also see the artistic side of it.â€

"Socialite Orhan Awatramani, popularly known as Orry, recently appeared on Salman Khanâ€™s Bigg Boss 17, and spent over a day in the house. Despite initially being welcomed by Salman as a â€˜wildcardâ€™ contestant, it was revealed that Orry wouldnâ€™t be participating in the show. However, Orry thoroughly enjoyed himself, as the contestants organised parties to make his short stay in the house a memorable one. Previously, an brief snippet of Orry saying that he has no idea who won the Menâ€™s Cricket World Cup went viral, but the socialite has now revealed that he was lying all along.
On the show, Abhishek Kumar asked Orry, â€œIndia jeet gaye?â€ A confused Orry asked, â€œKya jeet gaye?â€ Kumar replied, â€œWorld Cup?â€ Orry said, â€œWorld Cup next year hai na?â€  Reacting to his statement about the World Cup, Orry said in an interview with Siddharth Kannan, â€œOf course I knew the World Cup was on. I could not post anything on Instagram for two days because Instagram was filled with World Cup posts. I was talking to my manager about it, I had to push my posts by three days because all Instagram was talking about was cricket.â€

"Actors Ranbir Kapoor, Rashmika Mandanna, Bobby Deol and Anil Kapoor attended the Animal pre-release event in Hyderabad on Monday evening. Mahesh Babu and director SS Rajamouli were also present at the event. Mahesh praised Ranbir, hailing him as the finest actor in the country. However, speech made by a politician about how the Telugu industry will soon rule over Bollywood made for an awkward moment.
In the video doing rounds on the internet, Malla Reddy, Minister of Labour and Employment of Telangana, said, â€œEk baat bolna chahta hoon mai. Agle paanch saal mai, Bollywood and Hollywood, pura ruling karega humara Telugu industry. Ek saal ke baad Hyderabad shift hona padta, kyu bole toh Bombay purana hogaya, Bengaluru traffic jam hogaya. Hindustan mai ek he city hai, woh Hyderabad ( I want to say one thing. In the next five years, Bollywood and Hollywood will be ruled by our Telugu industry.

"Quite a few people have a quirky way of looking at things. Some treat wars like they are cricket matches, not considering the aftermath or the suffering it causes, and view cricket as if it were a war, forgetting that itâ€™s just a game. When news of tensions between countries comes up, there are always a few who suggest war as the solution, while comfortably sharing their opinions from the safety of their homes, far from border areas. In fact, even our movies, in a way, celebrate wars so much that they seldom shed much light on what happens to civilians during and after these intense battles.
National Award-winning director Dr Bijukumar Damodaran Tovino Thomas-starrerr Adrishya Jalakangal (Invisible Windows) is at its core an anti-war film with elements of magical realism."
"In the opening scenes of Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, Rocky Randhawa (played by Ranveer Singh) introduces his grandmother, Dhan Lakshmi (portrayed by Jaya Bachchan), as an ambitious, money-loving woman who catapulted their sweet business from a modest corner of Delhi to a global brand. While the film predominantly delves into Rockyâ€™s love story, a shift in focus towards Dhan Lakshmiâ€™s life would likely have rendered Rocky Aur Rani a much darker narrative. It would have depicted her unrelenting struggle to climb the social ladder and emancipating her family from the clutches of an unfulfilling middle-class existence in Delhi.
The Randhawa familyâ€™s palatial mansion, reminiscent of the US White House, and their fleet of luxurious cars signify their triumphant transition from dingy lanes to the opulent quarters of Delhi NCR, but the same things also underscore their deep-rooted fixation with material possessions.

"â€œKatte (donkey),â€ Priya calls Manu every now and then in Hemanth M Raoâ€™s Sapta Sagaradaache Ello â€“ Side A. Itâ€™s an affectionate nickname she uses for him. In a society that still clings to the traditional notion of Pati Parmeshwar, with even boyfriends often enforcing similar expectations on their girlfriends, or the latter conforming to the patriarchal norms, Priyaâ€™s choice of â€œKatteâ€ adds a unique warmth that no other alternative word there would have conveyed. The charm is heightened as Manu visibly lights up each time she addresses him with that endearing name.
In the sequel, Sapta Sagaradaache Ello â€“ Side B, however, the term is hardly ever mentioned, except for a few instances of flashbacks, essentially encapsulating the contrast between the two movies, or more specifically, the two entirely different junctures in their lives.

"â€œNot my monkey, not my circusâ€ is often the best way to deal with the noise on social media and pretty much everywhere. From whether Aishwarya Rai is getting along with her in-laws to Urfi Javed going from cringe to mainstream in what felt like seconds, itâ€™s a world that doesnâ€™t make sense. Itâ€™s like all the neighbourhood aunties and wannabes are collectively running the narrative. Whether in the real world or online, it just gets plain boring.
But there comes Orry or Orhan Awatramani and Iâ€™m hooked. Simply because itâ€™s so silly and so much fun. His rise (or fall) to fame is made special by the fact that he isnâ€™t trying too hard. Itâ€™s the world chasing him. The internet is bursting at the seams trying to figure out what he does for a living as he lives his best life. Unless thatâ€™s the plan of the â€œmarketing geniusâ€ as he once called himself. It could well be, as when quizzed on Koffee With Karan, his actor friend Ananya Pandey replied that heâ€™s â€œloved but misunderstoodâ€, which she was instructed to say by Orry himself.

"The deepfake video of Rashmika Mandanna shocked the film industry, with several celebrities, including Amitabh Bachchan, calling for authorities to take immediate action against the menace which has been on the rise for a while now. Rashmika also addressed the issue on social media, and now, during a press meet of her upcoming film Animal, starring Ranbir Kapoor in the lead role, the actor yet again opened up about her deepfake video.
Rashmika shared that such videos shouldnâ€™t be normalisedâ€“which has unfortunately become the status quo. The actor said, â€œSo many people came and supported from South industry, North industry. It made me realise that this does not have to be normalised. It made me feel safe, and secure. So I want to tell all girls out there that this is not normal. When something is affecting you, you donâ€™t have to keep quiet. When you take a stand, people will support you. Itâ€™s a good country that we live in.â€

"Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga made a name for himself with the nationwide success of Arjun Reddy, which was later remade in Hindi as Kabir Singh. Now, Sandeep is back with the film Animal which has Ranbir Kapoor and Anil Kapoor playing son and father, respectively. The trailer of Animal has raised several eyebrows for its portrayal of a toxic father-son relationship. Ranbirâ€™s character comes across as a menacing force who will not pay heed to anyone other than his father. While Ranbir seems a perfect fit for the role, Sandeep at a press meet in Hyderabad was asked who would he cast in the lead role if Animal is made in Telugu.
Responding to the question from a reporter, Ranbir expressed that he would like to play the lead in Telugu as well by saying, â€œSir I am also willing to learn Telugu language.â€ Meanwhile, Anil Kapoor interrupted and said, â€œAnil Kapoor.â€ However, Sandeep already has a name in his mind, and pat came the reply, â€œMahesh Babu.â€

"Vicky Kaushal-starrer Sam Bahadur and Ranbir Kapoor-starrer Animal are both releasing on the same day, December 1, and this might potentially affect the business of both these films at the box office. When Vicky was asked about this big clash at the Express Adda on Monday, the actor gave a rather poised answer and said that this wasnâ€™t a clash, but they were both playing for the same team, which is Hindi cinema.
The Meghna Gulzar directorial announced its release date way before Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s film and when Vicky was asked about this, the actor gave his answer using a cricket analogy. â€œWhen two opening batsmen come to the crease, playing for the same team, you wonâ€™t say that the two batsmen are clashing with each other, they are playing for a single team, so we are playing for Hindi cinema.â€

"Deepika Padukoneâ€™s 2020 film Chhapaak was based on the life of acid attack survivor and campaigner for rights of acid attack victims, Laxmi Agarwal. The movie was directed by Meghna Gulzar. Despite such strong backing, Chhapaak didnâ€™t do well at the box office. During the Express Adda on Monday, Meghna admitted that Deepikaâ€™s controversial visit to JNU just three days before the filmâ€™s release impacted its reception.
The director said, â€œI am sure that the answer is pretty obvious. Yes, of course, it made a dent on the film. Because the conversation went from acid violence, which I intended the film to amplify, to somewhere else. So, of course it impacted the film. There is no denying that.â€

At the Express Adda on Monday, Vicky was asked about being the â€œgreen flag husbandâ€ that the internet loves and the â€œred flagâ€ that he had to get rid of for his wife Katrina.
Vicky shared that the biggest complaint that Katrina always had from him was that he was â€œtoo stubbornâ€ and he consciously worked to get rid of this trait. â€œThe biggest complaint that Katrina has always had is that sometimes Iâ€™m too stubborn. That needed a little bit of moderation,â€ he said.

One such action set piece that has received praise from a lot of quarters is the one that is popularly referred to as the â€˜towel fight sceneâ€™.

He said, â€œSo, I had gone for the screening of the film, and we were watching the film. Obviously when the sequence came, in the middle of the sequence, I inclined towards her and said, â€˜I donâ€™t want to argue with you from now on. I donâ€™t want you to beat me up wearing a towel.â€™ I thought it was incredible the way she pulled it off. I told her, â€˜You are probably the most amazing action actress Bollywood has.â€™ So, I am really proud of the hard work she puts in. It is very inspiring to see her.â€

"After starring in two films this year, Vicky Kaushal is gearing up for the release of his much-awaited movie, Sam Bahadur. In a conversation with Anant Goenka, Executive Director of The Indian Express group, and film critic Shubhra Gupta at Express Adda, Vicky, along with Meghna Gulzar, spoke about his journey in the film industry and revealed why he thinks Anurag Kashyapâ€™s Raman Raghav 2.0 was his worst performance ever.
Speaking about Raman Raghav 2.0, Vicky said, â€œRaman Raghav 2.0 was directed by Anurag Kashyap. It was a very dark film. I was playing a cop which my mother was really happy about. But I didnâ€™t give her the details of what kind of a cop he is. The film was a very dark and twisted tale about a cop and a serial killer. To be very honest, I still feel that that is my worst performance till date because at that time I felt like I havenâ€™t lived through life experiences to get into the skin of the character. That is one role, I feel, every five years of my life, I will play it differently and I will play it better. I come from a protective upbringing and that is not what my characterâ€™s life was and at the age of 25, when I was playing that part, there was little bit of the gap that I had to fill to understand.â€

"The master of mass entertainers, Joshiy, is back with yet another actioner, poised to ignite the screens once again. Titled Antony, the makers of the movie unveiled its trailer on Monday and the promo emphasises that it is going to be an action spectacle with Joju George and Kalyani Priyadarshan at the centre.
The 152-second trailer opens with a brief introduction to Avaran City, the fictional setting of the film. As the promo unfolds, it provides glimpses of the place and its numerous ruthless criminals.

Among them, Antony Anthrapper (Joju George) stands out as the most infamous, described by a police officer as having killed a sub-inspector, setting him on fire. The trailer also vividly depicts Antonyâ€™s prowess as he single-handedly overpowers and defeats his rivals.

However, the teaser emphasises that he is not the only person to look out for. Ann Mariya (Kalyani Priyadarshan), despite her affectionate and compassionate nature, refuses to passively endure the challenges thrown at her by life and those around her. One of the characters remarks, â€œHer interest is more on violence than academics,â€ as she is portrayed in a boxing ring, dominating her opponent, and then outside, confronting her rivals. However, it also becomes evident that Antony has a soft spot for Ann.
Watch Antony trailer here:
Antony also marks the reunion of the team behind Joshiyâ€™s 2019 blockbuster Porinju Mariam Jose. In addition to Joju George and Kalyani Priyadarshan, Antony features Nyla Usha, Chemban Vinod Jose and Vijayaraghavan in significant roles. Its music is composed by Jakes Bejoy and Shyam Sasidharan handles the editing, mirroring the 2019 action film.
Penned by Rajesh Varma, the film has been bankrolled by Einstin Zac Paul under the banner of Einstin Media. While Renadive has handled its cinematography, Asha Sharath, Appani Sarath, Sijoy Varghese, Jewel Mary, Tini Tom, RJ Shaan, Jinu Joseph and Padmaraj Ratheesh will appear in key roles.

"If you grew up in the 90s in a Tamil household, you would have been fascinated by the climax scene in Rajinikanthâ€˜s commercial potboiler Manithan. For the showdown with the enemies, the actor is heavily armed. The iconic aspect of the whole costume is all those perfectly round grenades that dangle from his suit. As a blast from the past, Aruna Guhan, partner and creative director of AVM Productions, shared a video of the costume from the AVM museum.
Sharing the clip, Aruna wrote, â€œStep into our costume closet with me as I show you costumes from some of the biggest and most memorable @avmproductions movies. We are back with another trip into our Costume Closet, a special one worn by Superstar @rajinikanth himself, in Manithan for the climax fight.â€"
"Suhana Khan, daughter of Bollywood movie star Shah Rukh Khan, is all set to make her film debut with Zoya Akhtarâ€™s The Archies. The actor recently described herself as an â€œoverthinkerâ€ and said that she is an â€œanxious personâ€ who likes to workout when she is starting to feel overwhelmed. Suhana is on the brink of her big Bollywood debut and SRKâ€™s fans are waiting to watch how the next generation will carry his legacy.
In a chat with NDTV, when Suhana was asked about the role of physical fitness in staying healthy â€“ mentally and physically, the actor said, â€œFor me, working out or doing anything physical is more about the mind than your body. Sometimes Iâ€™ll be in a really bad mood or anxious about something because I am a very anxious person and I worry a lot over small things. So when I go to the gym and Iâ€™m working out for that one hour, nothing else matters.â€
Since the subject of The Archies deals with protecting the environment, Suhana was asked about the same and the actor spoke about sustainability. Suhana pointed that Alia Bhatt famously re-wore her wedding outfit for National Film Awards and if she can do that, â€œwe can also repeat an outfit for a party.â€

She did that and she took a stand towards sustainability and advocated for that. And if Alia Bhatt can re-wear her wedding saree then we can also repeat an outfit for a party.â€
Suhana is making her debut alongside Khushi Kapoor, Agastya Nanda, Aditi Dot, Vedang Raina, Mihir Ahuja and Yuvraj Menda. The Archies releases on Netflix on December 7.

At a recent event, Javed praised Zoyaâ€™s work across all her films and noted that every film of hers is unique. He also added that he was particularly skeptical when Zoya was making Gully Boy as he believed that she knew nothing about that world, considering she comes from an affluent background.
Speaking to Aaj Tak, Javed said, â€œWhen she was making Gully Boy, I was thinking how is she going to make it? You live on Bandstand, you travel to the UK, US for vacation, what would you know about slums? This is what I thought in my heart. Of course, I couldnâ€™t dare to say anything (laughs). But when I saw the film, I thought that she had lived in slums all her life. She had swallowed the culture of slums. She knew every detail of characters, their relationships.â€

"The teaser of Animal created quite a buzz. Fans were particularly excited to see Bobby Deol in a violent avatar. Their anticipation grew when they saw his bloodied face in the filmâ€™s trailer. Bobby plays the role of an antagonist in the film, something that his brother, Sunny Deol, and father, Dharmendra, have always avoided throughout their illustrious careers. During his recent interaction with the media in Chennai, Bobby shared why he didnâ€™t seek advice from his father and brother for his role in Animal and shared details about the â€œraw and brutalâ€ fight sequences in the film.
When asked if he sought advice from Sunny and Bobby for his role in Animal, Bobby said, â€œI donâ€™t think my dad or my brother have done many negative characters. But they have done a lot of action films. I have done a lot of action films in my life. My first film was an action film. It is a Deol thing, the Deols are known to be the action men.â€ Ranbir Kapoor, who was also present press meet, quickly chimed in, â€œThereâ€™s also this thing that Deols donâ€™t die.â€
Bobby added, â€œMy dad was the first He-Man and no one can be as tough as my brother. Gadar 2 proved that. He is the real action hero. So, I am lucky that I am a part of Animal and I got to do this action sequence. Ranbir and I really worked hard. The action sequence in the film is going to be so different and so well choreographed, so real. There are no special effects used in the fight sequences. It is just raw, brutal, like two Animals fighting.â€

Mamookka, you continue to amaze, i felt the pain, the loneliness, the fear, the weight of the decisions you had to take and every single look tugged at my heart. Best part of the movie for me was that â€˜Ente daivameâ€™ in the second half. Cried like a baby in the theatre. The music and the lyrics were so heart-wrenching. Jyotika mam, Omana is going to stay in our hearts for a long time. Thankyou for this movie Team Kaathal â€“ The Core.â€

"Even before the Baahubali phenomenon, SS Rajamouliâ€™s fantasy film Eega put him on the national radar. The story of an underdog in the form of a housefly avenging the villain might sound absurd on paper, but like always, Rajamouliâ€™s conviction and execution made the film a thorough entertainer back in 2012 when VFX and CGI wasnâ€™t as advanced and cost-efficient like now. One can only wonder what the film would have become had it been made by Rajamouli now. Nani, in a recent interview, said â€œit would undoubtedly become the biggest film of all timeâ€.
Speaking to India Today, Nani, who played the lead actor in Eega, said that he is sure that the film would get global recognition had it been released today. â€œWhat Rajamouli garu did back then was already mind-blowing, so imagine if he were to make Eega today with the current technology and his enhanced understanding. It would undoubtedly become the biggest film of all time and receive tremendous recognition,â€ he said."
"Ranbir Kapoor is waiting with bated breath for the release of his upcoming film Animal, which is already touted to be the biggest film of his career. Despite getting an â€˜Aâ€™ certificate from the Central Board Of Film Certification (CBFC) and having a long run time of 3 hours 21 minutes, the film has managed to rake in Rs 6.40 crore in advance booking. During his recent press meet in Bengaluru, Ranbir defended the filmâ€™s run time and ensured that it is going to be an entertaining ride. The actor also spoke about maintaining a balance of violence in the film that narrates a tale about father-son relationship.
Speaking about the run time of Animal, Ranbir said, â€œWe are not releasing a film this long because we are arrogant about it. We felt that the story required this amount of time to reach the audience in the best way possible.â€

"Filmmaker Zoya Akhtarâ€™s adaptation of the popular comic The Archies is all set to release on December 7. The Netflix original features seven new actors. Out of these seven actors, Khushi Kapoor, Suhana Khan and Agastya Nanda come from film families, and this has triggered the nepotism debate again. However, Zoyaâ€™s father and screenwriter-lyricist Javed Akhtar defends his daughter for launching star kids.
During Sahitya Aajtak 2023, Javed said that Zoya should be free to cast whoever she wants to cast, and as a director, it is her right. He added that it is not nepotism as she is introducing the star kids at her own risk and not because of their privileged backgrounds.

Apart from a small but successful stint in the television world with Star Plusâ€™ Saans, Neena had been struggling for each part that she got. And while things took a turn after the success of Badhaai Ho, Neena, in a recent interview, said that she continues to give auditions and opened up about getting rejected for Christopher Nolanâ€™s Tenet even though she traveled to Los Angeles for one day to meet the director.
Neena was auditioning for the role that was ultimately played by Dimple Kapadia and said that Dimple landed the role even without traveling to Los Angeles. In a chat with News 18 Showsha, Neena shared, â€œI still give auditions and get rejected. I went to LA this one time for a day just to meet (Christopher) Nolan [for Tenet].

"AFTER collaborating for Raazi (2018), which enjoyed both critical and commercial success, writer-director Meghna Gulzar and actor Vicky Kaushal reunited to work on Sam Bahadur, the upcoming biopic of Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw.
Over the years, both Gulzar and Kaushal have earned accolades for their impressive individual body of work.

"â€œWe are filmmakers first and then practitioners of any particular craft,â€ says Oscar-winning sound mixer Resul Pookutty, who recently made his directorial debut with Malayalam film Otta.
Pookutty, a sound designer, mixer and editor, has worked on more than 100 movies across languages including Slumdog Millionaire, for which he won the Oscar, Ghajini, Enthiran, Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja, Pushpa and Radhe Shyam.
His maiden film as a director, Otta, was based on author S. Hariharanâ€™s book Runaway Children, and working on the project was a huge learning experience for him.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œIt made me aware that you have to conduct your life every day as an inspiring person. You can have all the money in the world, but not be able to make a film. You can pay people, theyâ€™ll come and do work for you. But they wonâ€™t create something new.
â€œIf you want them to create something new along with you, you have to be a very inspiring character. And for me, in the 80 days that I shot, I was learning every day from everyone, despite the fact that I worked in more than 100 movies. For me, I was taking baby steps. It was an enriching experience, very beautiful,â€ Pookutty told PTI in an interview.
Also read | Otta movie review: Resul Pookuttyâ€™s Asif Ali, Indrajith-starrer is an overstretched semi-biographical infomercial
Otta, which was released in theatres in October this year, featured actors Asif Ali, Arjun Ashokan, Indrajith Sukumaran, Sathyaraj, Adil Hussain, Indrans and Divya Dutta.
Becoming a director does not mean that Resul Pookutty will stop working as a sound mixer, he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The artiste believes anyone working in cinema is a filmmaker first and then a â€œpractitioner of a particular craftâ€.
â€œThere are editors and cinematographers that become directors. They have not left their core job. I have not left my sound. I will not leave my sound. Weâ€™ve always been filmmakers. We are filmmakers first and then practitioners of a particular craft. Unless, thereâ€™s a good filmmaker inside you, youâ€™re not a good sound man. Youâ€™re not a cameraman or an editor unless there is a serious filmmaker within you. So you just found that out and then you just shift it,â€ he said.
Decoding his job as a sound mixer and designer, Pookutty said he makes the â€œfirst selective listeningâ€ for the audience who will watch the movie.
â€œSound in films is a subconscious art, you see things. When you see things, you understand what youâ€™re seeing but when you hear, youâ€™re hearing, not listening. So there is a difference between hearing and listening.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œAs a sound man, I am making selective listening for my audience. I want him or her to hear a particular thing and walk them through the narrative graph of the film. Thatâ€™s what I do,â€ he said.
Every film has its challenges, but language has never been a barrier in his work, Pookutty added.
â€œTo me, language doesnâ€™t matter. It is just a sound. Other than that, I donâ€™t look at language as a text. For me, it is an everyday expression. So Iâ€™m able to work in a Russian film, Iâ€™m able to work in Scandinavian movies, Iâ€™m able to work in a Punjabi film.
â€œAt the same time, I will create music for a Tamil movie or Malayalam movie and Hindi, so I just keep jumping around. So, as long as you understand that aspect of life, you can create new rhythms for every sequence.â€
ADVERTISEMENT
Resul Pookutty is currently attending the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), where he was part of a panel discussion, Road to Oscars.
He believes that compared to all other works of art, filmmaking and films are very refreshing and life changing.
â€œEvery film is a huge journey of someoneâ€™s life. You see human relationships, places, people, culture and language. Every film is walking through a lifetime. So, if you watch 50 films, itâ€™s like 50 lifetimes that youâ€™ve gone through and so of course it is going to enrich you. It will change you as a human being. It has made me a better version of me over time every time I do a film,â€ he said.
Pookutty said a platform like IFFI enables storytellers to understand how their contemporaries across the globe are doing and what theyâ€™re doing.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œYou understand cinema as a language and as a celluloid art, thatâ€™s what IFFI has given us. When we grow up, become what we have become, I will come back to IFFI and impart whatever knowledge I have acquired along the way,â€ he added.
The 54th edition of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) will conclude on November 28."

In an interview with Bollywood Thikana, Deepak Tijori said, â€œI saw a film, A Kiss Before Dying, and narrated a story to them. Back then, this is how it used to function, there was no concept of copyright, studios system had not come into play. So, most films were inspired by Hollywood films.

â€œSo, I gave a narration to the three brothers and told them that this is a villain role which I will do and they can cast other heroes and other roles. They agreed. Then Khiladi released, followed by Jo Jeeta Woh Sikandar. Now people from the distribution circle were looking at me like I am progressing and soon enough I will become a hero.â€

The brothers then said they have already committed themselves to Venus with Shah Rukh as the lead. If we back out now, it will be a question 0n our career.

â€œThe credit for that goes to Ashu. All three of us were good friends of his. He was after Shah Rukh and Aamir to do the film, but they werenâ€™t saying yes to him. He was an actor not trained as a director. They were already rising stars, so perhaps didnâ€™t want to take that risk. I asked Ashu. He told me even you are refusing it.
â€œI was also on the rise then, so I told him that he should go ahead and make it with me as my name can get funding. All friends came together to star in the film.

He added, â€œThe director was introduced to me by editor Shameer Muhammed, who asked me if I could write a script for Vysakh. Later, Vysakh and I had a conversation, getting to know each other. I suggested a few scripts I had in hand. While discussing a suitable project, I proposed an action film script to him. He liked it and we proceeded to present the script to Mammooka. He, too, was ready to sign the project, and things began from there.â€"
"A Zoya spin off film cannot be complete without her Tiger. Superstar Salman Khan says he is totally game for Katrina Kaif headlining a solo action film of her spy character Zoya, but with a slight additionâ€“ he will also join the movie.
In Yash Raj Filmsâ€™ Tiger series, Salman features in the titular role as RAW agent, while Katrina plays Zoya, a Pakistani spy. The two characters, first appeared in Kabir Khanâ€™s 2011 film Ek Tha Tiger, are married and continue to fight for the country. Salman and Katrina are currently seen playing their fan favourite characters in Tiger 3.
During a press conference to talk about his latest Diwali release, Salman Khan was asked his thoughts about a spin off film featuring Zoya. The superstar said the film can be about Zoya but will definitely also feature his character Tiger.

â€œYa why not. But I think Zoya would be very incomplete without Tiger. So, Tiger will have to be there and save the day in the climax. Even if he is not there throughout the film, but there has to be a Tiger introduction, a telephone call (to him), a hook in the interval. Then in the climax, when Zoya needs Tiger, he lands up there to make sure that together they accomplish the mission,â€ he said.
Salman said the two characters have now become inseparable. The superstar joked that he can come in a Zoya spin off film, but Katrina wouldnâ€™t be so keen to do a limited screen-time role if tables were turned.

â€œTiger and Zoya have become so synonymous that me without Zoya or Zoya without me will feel empty. But if we tell the same thing to Zoya, that there will be her introduction, then she will come in the interval then a bit in the climax, woh jhel nahi payegi (she wonâ€™t be able to take it). Woh apna role badate jayegi (She will keep increasing her role),â€ he added.
Directed by Maneesh Sharma, Tiger 3 also stars Emraan Hashmi. The movie has been an underperformer at the box office, minting Rs 264 crore at the domestic box office. It failed to live up to the gigantic pre-release expectations and will likely take a big hit at the box office this Friday when Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s Animal releases.

The duo recently appeared on Indian Idol season 14, and set the stage on fire with their performance on the song â€œSaami Saami,â€ from the Allu Arjun-starrer Pushpa, which also featured Rashmika.

Rani said that the film revealed a lot of uncomfortable truths about Indian marriages, which led to a spike in the divorce rate.
The actor said that the film was an eye-opener: â€œI think what happened with Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna was that, after the film (was released), there were a lot of divorces. There were a lot of people going to the theatre and watching the film in extreme discomfort.

He alleged that Suri stole an idea that he had presented to producer Mahesh Bhatt, and to this day hasnâ€™t admitted that he went behind his back. The film in question was Suriâ€™s directorial debut, Zeher, and Tijori has claimed that it was initially his idea to do the film.
In an interview with Bollywood Thikana, Tijori said, â€œI wanted to work with Mahesh Bhatt. I went to narrate the film to him, while he was on the treadmill. He heard me for like 15-20 minutes and then he said, â€œI did not enjoy it.â€™ Forget it.â€ Tijori said that the idea was basically an unofficial remake of the Denzel Washington-starrer Out of Time.

"Singer Amit Sana, the runner-up of Indian Idol season 1, recently accused the show of rigging voting lines in the favour of winner Abhijeet Sawant. In an interview with Siddharth Kannan, Amit claimed that the channel blocked his lines before the finale and helped Abhijeet win the show. Now, Abhijeet has responded to Amitâ€™s claims.
Also speaking to Siddharth Kannan, he said in Hindi, â€œI have to come to the show only to give a clarification about these claims. So, yeh jhooth hai (This is a lie). If I speak truly, we were all kids at the time. If lines were blocked, then me and Rahul should have been in the top two. Because Rahul has always been a favourite of everyone. Rahul also made a good career after Indian Idol. He is doing good work even today. He did a show like Bigg Boss. He has always been popular. So if lines were blocked, then Amit wouldnâ€™t have even made it to the finals. And who was I? Why would they block the lines for me? I struggled a lot, I did well on each song that I performed to reach the final. I was called an under-dog, a dark horse. It was not in our hands.â€
He added, â€œIn life, when we regret and blame things on other people, we do it to reduce pressure on ourselves. After you blame someone, you become free. But you shouldnâ€™t do that. You have to just work, we are all here to work and not to blame each other. During the show, if he was naive, so was I, I didnâ€™t work for the Ambani family. It is not possible to block lines because it is such a big show, it can cause riots. The votes came in crores.â€

Speaking about success of the contestants post Indian Idol, Abhijeet said, â€œAfter the show, albums came out. First my album came, then Amitâ€™s came and for Rahul music directors, Sajid-Wajid, did the whole album. But my album sold 13 lakh copies and their albums couldnâ€™t even cross a lakh. So you say your lines were blocked, but people can buy your album right? There should be a right theory to explain this claim, but that theory doesnâ€™t exist.â€

"Salman Khan is basking in the success of his latest YRF venture, the third installment of Tiger franchise, Tiger 3, with Katrina Kaif. The actor, who is seen as one of the biggest superstars in the country, said that he rejects such terms, and urged others to stop using them for him.
In a group interview, Salman told indianexpress.com that while he doesnâ€™t consider himself a superstar, it is his walk that often gives a wrong impression. He said, â€œWhoever is a superstar in his mind is a superstar. I donâ€™t think of that at all, so I am not. People like to be called superstars and megastars, thatâ€™s something that I donâ€™t like.â€

â€œMy arrogant walk makes people feel I am a superstarâ€
â€œStardom doesnâ€™t show in the way I am, but I am sure it shows in my walk. My walk is considered to be an arrogant walk but thatâ€™s the way I walk and I cannot change that walk, and I am comfortable in that walk and I am comfortable in my skin. Sometimes it comes out in a way that â€˜yeh dekho, inki chaal dekho, kya samajhte hai? (Look at him, his walk, what does he think of himself)?â€™ But Iâ€™ve been walking like that from childhood. Now if I walk like someone else then it wonâ€™t suit me. So, now this is who I am, what I do. But yes, I donâ€™t believe in this superstardom, and I have not done anything that I can take the credit of superstardom. Everyone, from our DOP (director of photography) to the scriptwriter to the director help this normal average Bandra boy look heroic on screen. That credit, I donâ€™t like taking alone at all.â€

Salman then addressed the lull that he faced in his career over the last few years when his films Antim and Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan failed. He said, â€œThe lows that you are talking about, the lows that I have been through, maybe the highest point of 99.9% of the country. So that low also, if I say that it was a low point for me then fans will say â€˜yeh low hai toh hamara kya hai?â€™(If these are your lows then what about ours?)

Despite that, he said, he takes full responsibility for his flops.

You need to keep competing with yourself, you are anyway competing with your juniors and seniors but it is very important to compete with yourself.â€
Not doing YRF film for 21 years
Salman then spoke about how and why Ek Tha Tiger was his first venture with YRF after 21 years. When asked if it was worth the wait, he said, â€œSo, you need to ask Adi (YRF head honcho Aditya Chopra) this question. It is not that I did not do a YRF film for the longest time, Adi did not do a Salman Khan film for the longest time. That is the question that I donâ€™t answer, he answers that. But was it worth the wait? It was worth the wait for Adi as well.â€

"Ranbir Kapoor recently appeared on Indian Idol season 14 to promote his upcoming film Animal, along with co-star Rashmika Mandanna. On the show, Ranbirâ€™s father-in-law, Mahesh Bhatt, shared a special video message for the actor, praising him as the â€œworldâ€™s best father.â€ Ranbir is married to actor Alia Bhatt, with whom he has daughter Raha.
In the special video, Mahesh said, â€œAlia, who I believe is a miracle, says Ranbir is one of the best actors in our country. But I believe Ranbir is the worldâ€™s best father. When he sees Raha (Ranbir and Aliaâ€™s daughter), I wish you could see his eyes at that time.

"Salman Khan, known for his action-packed films, is currently witnessing box office success with his latest project, Tiger 3. In a recent conversation, the actor reflected on his journey before entering the film industry, highlighting the extensive groundwork he puts into his projects even before they commence filming.
Speaking at a recent press conference, Salman opened up about his struggling days before he entered the film industry and said, â€œPeople say that we will put in all the work after we get the film. All these things, I have done much before I came into the industry. The four-five years of struggle that I did before I came into the industry, before I did films like Maine Pyar Kiya and Biwi Ho To Aisi. After that also, whenever I sign a movie, I have to like it in the first narration. If I like a film, I shift that film before my other projects. And the projects that I have postponed, they will likely not happen. Until that time, I wonâ€™t sign another film. That is what I usually concentrate on.â€
Talking about how he has to maintain a disciplined lifestyle and put in a lot of hard work before reaching the set, Salman said, â€œI donâ€™t see you guys catching me anywhere, no parties and nothing. I shoot and I go back home. All the discussions that I have are either on Being Human, which is mostly about family stuff, friends and movies. The hard work is done at home with the director. Thatâ€™s why on the set it is perceived as, â€˜This man comes, looks here and there, drinks coffee, gives the shot and leaves.â€™ But all the work has been done before I land up on the set. I donâ€™t believe in going out and gossiping, bitching about people and following the box office numbers of other films. I donâ€™t believe in that.â€

"Veteran actor Neena Gupta has dispensed her two cents on feminism. Rejecting the feminist theory that asserts men and women are equal, she said that this isnâ€™t true because men canâ€™t give birth. The actor stressed the importance of financial independence regardless of gender. Additionally, she stated that â€˜women need menâ€™ and provided a personal example to support her statement.
In a conversation with Ranveer Allahbadia, Neena said in Hindi, â€œI want to say that itâ€™s not necessary to believe in â€˜faltu feminismâ€™ or the idea that â€˜women are equal to men.â€™ Instead, focus on achieving financial independence and giving attention to your work. If youâ€™re a housewife, donâ€™t look down on it; itâ€™s an important role. Boost your self-esteem and avoid thinking of yourself as small. Thatâ€™s the main message I want to convey. Additionally, men and women are not equal. The day men start getting pregnant, that day we will be equal.â€
The actor gave an example to support her statement that â€˜women need menâ€™, and said, â€œI had to catch a flight once at 6 a.m. I did not have a boyfriend at that time. I came out of the house at 4 a.m. and it was dark. A man started following me, I went back to my house and I missed my flight. The next day I booked the same flight.

"As December 1 approaches, the box office clash between Vicky Kaushalâ€™s Sam Bahadur and Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s Animal is creating anticipation among fans. While both films have managed to generate considerable pre-release buzz, Ranbirâ€™s violent crime saga is surging ahead of Vicky Kaushalâ€™s biopic.
According to industry tracker Sacnilk, Animal has already sold over 111,000 tickets across India, with 90,526 tickets in Hindi, 20,591 in Telugu-speaking regions, and 200 in Tamil-speaking areas. The film has amassed an impressive advance booking collection of Rs 3.4 crore. The film is expected to deliver the biggest opening of Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s career.

Meanwhile, Sam Bahadur has secured 12,876 advance bookings, amassing a collection of Rs 44.71 lakh prior to its release.

"Koffee with Karan Season 8 was announced with a very well-made promo where Karanâ€™s konscience, with a k of course, trolled him about the shortcomings of Season 7. From the inappropriate questions on the sex lives of his proteges to lengthy monologues that he struggled to deliver, the conscience with a k had done his consumer research and an in-depth study of the comments section on social media. But Season 8, now streaming on Disney +Hotstar, doesnâ€™t manage to brew a fresh pot of kon-versations with every episode, mostly serving reheated coffee on a new couch.
Season 8 started with Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh whom Karan introduced as Bollywood royalty. The two looked lovely and demonstrated just how much equality is there in their relationship by equally dividing the talking points during the episode. Ranveer spoke in the first half while Deepika nodded coyly and she took over in the second half of the episode to talk about issues close to her heart. The highlight of the episode for me though was not the wedding video which seemed too much of an orchestrated PR exercise, but Karan and Deepikaâ€™s candid admissions about having anxiety attacks and not always being as put together as they seem. It was refreshingly honest, brave and a glimpse into how hard it is for sensitive, creative minds to be in such an unrelentingly competitive business."

In a new interview, Bajpayee, while discussing whether he cries or not in his personal life, revealed that his daughter Ava always wanted to see him cry. He told Pinkvilla, â€œMy daughter wanted to see me crying. I told her, â€˜Nowadays, I cry very rarely.

When Indian Idol 14â€™s contestant Menuka asked the actor about the songs he sings to Raha, Ranbir said, â€œDo gaane hai, Ek to English song hai thoda irritating sa, Baby Shark Do Do Do Do and dusra and â€˜Lalla Lalla Lori (There are two songs. One is an English song which is a bit irritating)â€™
Singer Shreya Ghoshal, who is one of the judges on Indian Idol, was amused by his revelation. Being a parent herself, Shreya related with Ranbir, and shared how the playlist of people changes once they become parents.

"Late filmmaker-actor-politician Sunil Dutt was a strict taskmaster and it is evident from a recent anecdote that Karan Johar narrated from the sets of the 1971 film Reshma Aur Shera. Dutt was the star of the film, and also the director. It also starred Waheeda Rehman, Amitabh Bachchan, Raakhee, Ranjeet, and Amrish Puri, among others. Karanâ€™s late father and producer, Yash Johar was the production controller on the film.
During the shoot of Reshma Aur Shera, Dutt asked Johar that he needed 100 camels for a scene. Karan recalled during an interaction with Film Companion, â€œDutt sahab told my father overnight that for Reshma Aur Shera, he wanted 100 camels. My father was a production controller so he was given these requirements. Overnight, he went to the nearby villages and got the camels. They werenâ€™t 100.â€
An â€˜exhaustedâ€™ and â€˜sleep-deprivedâ€™ Yash Johar went to Dutt and told him he couldnâ€™t arrange 100 camels, but they were 99. â€œHe told him, â€˜Dutt sahab, I am sorry. I couldnâ€™t get you 100 camels. But I could get you 99.â€™ Dutt sahab looked at him and said â€˜Pack upâ€™ and walked off. He was serious because they werenâ€™t 100 but 99 camels,â€ shared Karan.

"Actor Richa Chadhaâ€™s role of young and feisty Bholi Punjaban in the Fukrey franchise is much appreciated by the audience. Her performance in films like Gangs of Wasseypur, Masaan and Love Sonia, among others has also received critical acclaim. But there was a time when she was offered the role of actor Hrithik Roshanâ€™s mother, despite him being older than her.
In an interview with ABPLive, Richa recalled the incident and also highlighted how itâ€™s not fair to older artists who already have limited work.
When asked if she got angry at the casting director, Richa replied, â€œYes, because I was 21 years old. But someone had told him that I play the role of older women nicely. So without thinking, he just offered me the role. Later, the actor who actually played that part is a very good artist. So I felt that this is wrong that you are taking young and attractive actors and ageing them.â€

Richa felt it was not only unfair to her but also to the older artists who fit the role better than her. â€œNot only are you doing a disservice to a young actor, you are also taking away an older actorâ€™s part which is already shrinking.â€
She added, â€œTo usool ke hisaab se bhi maine mana kia tha. Baaki uss casting director ne mujhe kabhi bulaya nahi wo alag baat hai. (So, I refused to do it on moral ground. But that casting director never called me again, also).â€
In Gangs of Wasseypur, Richa played an older girl. Justifying why she took up the role, the actor said that in the Anurag Kashyap film, she was not the only one whose character was aged.
â€œIn Gangs of Wasseypur, I never felt that I would be singled out. Everyoneâ€™s story was 30-40 years ahead. They didnâ€™t put any spotlight on me. Call it our industryâ€™s sexism or societyâ€™s sexism, they highlighted it. The truth is that Manoj Bajpayee, Huma Qureshi, Piyush Mishra, all of them had undergone ageing in that film,â€ said Richa.

Richa Chadha will be next seen in Anubhav Sinhaâ€™s Abhi Toh Party Shuru Hui Hai. The cast of the film also includes Saurabh Shukla, Pankaj Tripathi, Vinay Pathak, Pavan Malhotra, Divya Dutta, Kumud Mishra, Manoj Pahwa, Dilip Prabhavalkar, Cyrus Broacha, Prateik Babbar and Shriya Pilgaonkar.

"The OTT boom has significantly contributed to Indian cinema, especially by introducing numerous talented actors and technicians with no prior industry connections. Among them, who have now become highly cherished, Vijay Varma stands out for his exceptional performances and thoughtful choices.
In 2023 alone, Vijay featured in two films â€” Lust Stories 2 and Jaane Jaan â€” as well as two web series â€” Dahaad and Kaalkoot â€” garnering praise from all quarters for his outstanding performances.
During a recent session at Sahitya Aaj Tak OTT 2023, Vijay openly discussed his career, highlighting the challenges of portraying a ruthless villain in Jasmeet K Reenâ€™s Darlings and how it left him exhausted after a certain point.

Discussing his portrayal of antagonist roles in Darlings and Reema Kagti and Zoya Akhtarâ€™s Dahaad, both of which garnered the actor significant acclaim, Vijay shared that embodying these characters presented substantial and unique challenges. He explained, â€œThe character in Darlings was actively violent. It was challenging as I constantly sought to understand why he behaved that way, raising his hands on people and speaking in a certain manner. In real life, I am nothing like that. Playing the violent character every day eventually took a toll on me. I got tired after a while. Then there was a point during shooting a specific sequence when my hands were tied to a chair for 10-15 days. Initially, I was the one inflicting harm, but later, others turned the tables, and I found myself on the receiving end.â€
â€œIn Dahaad, on the other hand, the character I portrayed didnâ€™t involve much on-screen violence; whatever actions he took were executed silently,â€ he noted.
When enquired about his approach to portraying such intense villainous characters, Vijay expressed his readiness to embrace any role that satisfies his hunger. He also drew parallels between his life story and that of the turtle from the tale of â€œThe Tortoise and the Hareâ€.

Regarding his skill in acing close-up shots through eye and facial expressions, Vijay observed that the eyes convey the most when we see or interact with a person. â€œSo, I believe that whatever is going through your mind, even if you attempt to conceal it, your eyes wonâ€™t be able to lie.â€
ADVERTISEMENT
Discussing the differences in working across theatre, film and OTT platforms, Vijay expressed, â€œI was born in the theatre realm, worked in films, and currently working a lot in streaming platforms. I havenâ€™t perceived significant differences among them. An actorâ€™s responsibility is to understand the script and their character, learn the dialogues and work hand-in-hand with those involved in the production. While their pitching and metres may vary, each medium mutually benefits actors.â€
ICYMI | Vijay Varma recalls feeling â€™embarrassedâ€™ when Tigmanshu Dhulia said he would be the next Irrfan: â€˜I wanted to disappearâ€™
Vijay also highlighted his longing for involvement in big projects suitable for the theatres, expressing anticipation for those he is already part of. Sharing insights into his most admired figures in Bollywood, Vijay remarked, â€œI am currently working on a project with Naseeruddin Shah, and he is someone I aspire to learn a great deal from. Irrfan Khan is a person I hold deep affection for. In my perception, he continues to live on. Who isnâ€™t a fan of Shah Rukh Khan, including me? Tabu is also among my preferred performers.â€
He also noted a shift in his approach to roles, revealing that he stopped taking on roles solely for money after being fired from a film where he portrayed a small reporterâ€™s role at a time when he had a mere Rs 18 in his bank account.

"Filmmaker Karan Johar has a lot of information about everything that was happening on the film sets back in the 1960s and 1970s, courtesy, his late father Yash Johar. He recently revealed that his father was present on the sets of various films, including K Asifâ€™s monumental film Mughal-E-Azam (1960). The senior Johar told his son about one of the days when Mughal-E-Azam was being shot and suddenly K Asif announced pack-up and didnâ€™t resume shooting for the next three days.
During an interaction with Film Companion, KJo said, â€œMy father was on the sets of Mughal-E-Azam. I have voluminous information of the things that were happening on the set at that time, the dynamic between actor and director, actress and director.â€
He added, â€œMy father told me about a moment how K Asif announced pack-up because they didnâ€™t have real â€˜ittarâ€™ and he wanted real â€˜ittarâ€™ in the pond so that Madhubala could give up that close-up as a result of that whiff that she would get. She had to give that whiff to give that beauteous expression.â€

Karan shared that though the production team had filled the pond with water â€œlike anybody would doâ€, K Asif was not happy and didnâ€™t agree to shoot until â€˜ittarâ€™ was arranged. â€œItâ€™s a production requirement, you canâ€™t fill in a pond full of real ittar. They said they would take three days to fill it with â€˜ittarâ€™. He packed up and didnâ€™t shoot for three days until that pond was full of â€˜ittarâ€™,â€ Karan shared.
K Asifâ€™s Mughal-e-Azam is considered as one of the best Indian films of all time. The timeless love story of Salim-Anarkali and the tale of a son rebelling against his emperor father Akbar continues to be a representative of Indian cinema internationally. It starred Prithviraj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar and Madhubala in the lead roles.
K Asif started the process of making this film in 1944 and took 16 years to complete it.

Now I am literally evaluating if I am genuinely so â€˜humbleâ€™ or if I am a sharp witted man who acts to be a humble man. I am still discovering it. So am I really humble? Because even I get angry.

"Salman Khan and Katrina Kaifâ€˜s Tiger 3 has been in the theatres for nearly two weeks after it released on Diwali and after 13 days, the film has managed to collect Rs 258.37 crore at the domestic box office. On Friday, the filmâ€™s recorded its lowest collect yet as it could only manage to bring in Rs 3.5 crore, as per industry tracker Sacnilk.

"People complain about Akshay Kumar filming full movies without setting foot outside the studio, but they should know that Liam Neeson spends nearly the entire run time of his latest actioner, Retribution, literally on his butt. Nobody can fault him for agreeing to what must have been a handsome payday for acting with just the upper-half of his body. But after promising that he was done with this sort of thing, youâ€™d imagine that only an excellent idea would convince him to return. Unfortunately, to call Retribution forgettable would be paying it a compliment; itâ€™s the kind of movie that feels designed to guilt you into doing something worthwhile with your life.
While the title could theoretically be applied to any kind of movie under the sun â€” I could tell you that Retribution is a stoner comedy and you wouldnâ€™t know â€” itâ€™s also indicative of the amount of thought that the entire project has been put together with. Which is to say, not a lot. Itâ€™s as if a producer watched the original Spanish movie upon which it is based, hired somebody to slap together an adaptation, and got Lionsgate to green-light it based on the first draft itself.

"Remember the frequent scenes of fervent chaos and bustling energy in films by Lijo Jose Pellissery and Tinu Pappachan? These are the moments portraying people shedding even the slightest trace of goodness in them, adopting a raw and animalistic demeanour. What if a comedy film embraces this approach, releasing a lively crowd on-screen, and engaging in conflicts while ensuring that humour is prevalent? G Marthandanâ€™s Maharani is, in a nutshell, exactly this, although it lacks some of the elements that characterised the movies of the aforementioned filmmakers.
Set in Alappuzha district, Ajeesh aka Aji (Shine Tom Chacko) and Vijeesh aka Viji (Roshan Mathew) are brothers whose bond is akin to best friends, with no secrets between them. They also share a warm relationship with their father (Johny Antony). Viji, a local casanova, has a history of multiple girlfriends but is contemplating jilting all of them to focus on one, only because she comes from a wealthy family. Meanwhile, Ajeesh plans to marry his girlfriend Kavya (Sruthy Jayan), who belongs to an upper caste and hence she is eloping from her home.

"Actors donâ€™t need to be categorised in boxes, says Divya Dutta, a versatile performer who is happy that female artists are finally getting the space to experiment without being pigeonholed. In a career spanning over 25 years, Dutta has delivered critically praised performances in films such as Shaheed-e-Mohabbat Boota Singh, Veer-Zaara, Delhi-6, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and Badlapur to name a few.
The actor believes that earlier the industry standards were different for male actors when they would venture out of their comfort zone and try something new with their characters.
â€œI have seen that male actors are still given that leeway of being called actors whatever they might do. If you have Nawaz, you had Irrfan (Khan), Manoj (Bajpayee) and now it is Vijay Sethupathi, they can just cross over, do any role and then come back to what they were doing and do it so brilliantly. But with women, it was a little less when you had a woman doing a different role, especially the pre-OTT era,â€ Dutta told PTI in an interview.

The 46-year-old actor said when she tried to experiment with her roles, people would find different labels to describe her.

â€œFor female actors, I think that gradually happened. Now Iâ€™m called an actor. But I do feel itâ€™s nice to not follow that clichÃ© norm of belonging to a box. We donâ€™t belong in any boxes. We make our own skies, we shine and just star in them,â€ Dutta said.

  A post shared by Divya Dutta (@divyadutta25)
The actor recalled that someone used the term â€œunconventionalâ€ to describe her as an artiste and she now owns it.
â€œWhen OTT wasnâ€™t there and when I was doing only feature films, people didnâ€™t know where to place me because I wasnâ€™t really romancing the hero but I had the best role in the film. So they didnâ€™t know what to call me. So they started calling me the unconventional heroine. And I just loved it because itâ€™s nice to carve your own path rather than just follow something thatâ€™s there.â€ Dutta said she is glad to have a career where she â€œcan cross the images and the roles that are givenâ€.
â€œI love to play a villain, I love to do comedy, I love to romance my hero. Iâ€™m doing all three of those and yet I donâ€™t have an image. So Iâ€™m happy about that,â€ she said.

The Ludhiana-born actor currently serves as a jury member for the best web series (OTT) award at the ongoing International Film Festival of India (IFFI) here.
The award category, incorporated at the festival with the current edition, will be presented to a show for its â€œartistic merit, storytelling excellence, technical prowess and overall impactâ€.
The jury is headed by filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani and also includes Bengali superstar Prosenjit Chatterjee, filmmakers Krishna DK and Utpal Borpujari.
â€œItâ€™s first a matter of great honour. Itâ€™s the first time this kind of award has been inculcatedâ€¦ It is also a huge responsibility because what Iâ€™m advised to watch as an audience is different, but when you watch as a jury, then you have such a wide diversity of shows and theyâ€™re all so good.

â€œSo it becomes difficult, but I think itâ€™s a process which when you sit with like-minded people will come to a conclusion.â€ Dutta has been part of two OTT shows â€” â€œSpecial OPSâ€ and Hostages â€” which premiered on streaming service Disney+ Hotstar.
She said she has worked on two-three more projects that will be released in the coming year.
â€œFor an actor, it doesnâ€™t really make much of a difference, except that there is an increase in the number of dates. But then itâ€™s a role and you play it in a different medium, itâ€™s just that. I think things have changed for the production, for directors and writers more so than for actors,â€ Dutta said.

"Actors Ranbir Kapoor and Bobby Deol attended the music launch of their upcoming film Animal on Friday. At the event, they were joined by the movieâ€™s producer Bhushan Kumar and the entire team of musicians who worked on the filmâ€™s songs. Before releasing the music of the film, Ranbir and Bobby indulged in a fun banter where they answered questions about each other. Bobby also revealed Ranbir was always on a video call with his newborn daughter Raha during the shoot of the film.
Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt were blessed with their first child Raha while the former was shooting for Animal. As the filmâ€™s shoot came to an end, she turned one year old. Bobby shared, â€œI have seen him face-timing her all the time. I have never met her, but even while we were coming back from Delhi (where Animalâ€™s trailer was launched), he was there (on a call). His daughter is such a cutie. She has grown.â€

"New voices should be applauded and given a platform, said Manoj Bajpayee on Friday as he lamented the lack of mentorship provided by the streaming services to independent filmmakers.
During a panel discussion at the 54th International Film Festival of India (IFFI) here, the actor said when the streaming services started in India, they backed independent storytellers but now these platforms are giving priority to blockbuster films.
â€œOne thing that all streaming services started with initially was that they were making independent cinema but that got lost somewhere. For some reason, it has gone down completely and now we see blockbuster films making their way big time.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œBut the independent cinema movement that started and was getting such mentorship from the OTT platforms, is gone. And that is a very sad development,â€ Bajpayee said.
If there is no independent cinema, then the Indian film industry will not evolve, he stressed.
â€œWe will only grow in terms of money but we will not grow as creative people. New voices should be applauded and given platforms. I think they were doing so beautifully well earlier,â€ he added.

Manoj Bajpayee said it is unimaginable for independent films to get funding at par with tentpoles such as Jawan, Pathaan or Tiger 3.
â€œIt canâ€™t stand a chance and if youâ€™re giving shows at 9 am for an independent film, it will never do well. It will fall flat. I really request from this stage to all these platforms that they should revive that mentorship,â€ the actor said.

Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK, the co-creators of Bajpayeeâ€™s popular OTT series The Family Man, agreed with Bajpayee.
â€œEarlier, all these films were directly made or shown on OTT. Now it is a clause that it has to play in theatres and only then we will take it,â€ Nidimoru said.
Krishna added, â€œThis is happening worldwide right now. There used to be a time when there would be a film and then there would be an OTT movie. But The Russo Brothers made The Gray Man for Netflix and it is as big as any theatrical film. So now every film is a big film.â€

â€œThere is no safe home left for independent films and that is happening because a lot of resources are going into the blockbusters. I believe independents help filmmakers to become better show creators and directors,â€ she said.
Raj Nidimoru said being an independent filmmaker taught him and Krishna DK to be self-sufficient.
â€œWe didnâ€™t know anyone in the industry, we taught ourselves. So this whole package of indie cinema gave us the confidence that wherever you give us, we can make a film, irrespective of the budget and the stars. I think thatâ€™s what still keeps us going,â€ he said.
Krishna believes independent filmmaking helps in coming to terms with the fact that â€œyou wonâ€™t get everything you wantâ€.

â€œYou kind of adapt then, I think jugaad is the word. You somehow get the job done and thatâ€™s how we started making filmsâ€¦ Then this OTT and series concept came to India. We were fans of the shows from the West but nobody knew how to make a series in India. I think that jugaad mentality and idea of going back and figuring out how it is done, that came in handy,â€ he added.
The 54th edition of IFFI will conclude on November 28.

"Salman Khan and Katrina Kaifâ€™s spy-thriller Tiger 3 has slowed down significantly at the box office. While it was expected to have a collection at par with Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Pathaan and Jawan, it has not even earned half of what both the films earned during their lifetime. On its second Friday, the filmâ€™s collection fell to around Rs 2.27 crore from Thursdayâ€™s Rs 5.12 crore.
As per early estimates (posted at 7 pm) by industry tracker Sacnilk, Tiger 3 had Hindi occupancy of 7.85% and 10.14% in the morning and afternoon shows, respectively. The filmâ€™s total domestic collection after 13 days stands at Rs 257.14 crore. With such an underwhelming performance at the ticket counters, it looks like a tough task for the Maneesh Sharma directorial to even earn as much as the previous film in the franchise, Tiger Zinda Hai. It earned Rs 339.16 crore upon its release in 2017.

"A sequel to the 2003 release Munna Bhai M.B.B.S, Lage Raho Munna Bhai, directed by Rajkumar Hirani and starring Sanjay Dutt in the lead role, could have been a completely different film had Dutt not gone for a haircut while shooting for it. Lyricist Swanand Kirkira, in a new interview, revealed why Hirani rewrote the entire script of the 2006 film.
Lage Raho Munna Bhai promoted the philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi. But when the shoot of the film began, it had a different script. Kirkire recently told Mashable India, â€œLage Raho Munna Bhai was to be made in a certain way, but then Sanjay Dutt got a haircut in the middle of the filmâ€™s shoot.

However, Ridley Scott, a director of big men and big spectacles, is not interested in anything as complex. His Napoleon, written by David Scarpa, is an impressively mounted biography of the general who would redefine the battlefield, but you will come away not much wiser about the man himself.

Dr Bijuâ€™s Adrishya Jalakangal, starring Tovino Thomas and Nimisha Sajayan in the lead roles, tells the story of a group of people devoid of any privileges and powers in the society, even as the government and its machinery prepare for a potential war.

"Though this new animation film from Disney doesnâ€™t roll out something absolutely fresh, it pieces together enough feel-good elements from the studioâ€™s much-loved cinematic universe to showcase the adventures of yet another gritty young woman, Asha (which means â€˜hopeâ€™ in Hindi). The musical packs oodles of cuteness, several songs, magic and conflicts for a fun ride that would make for a perfect family viewing with young ones.
Riding on nostalgia associated with classic tales, the film boasts of a talented team with Oscar-winning actor Ariana DeBose being cast as Asha; Chris Pine as Magnifico; Angelique Cabral as graceful Queen Amaya and Alan Tudyk as Ashaâ€™s favorite goat, Valentino. The film is helmed by director Chris Buck (â€˜Frozenâ€™ and â€˜Frozen 2â€™) and Fawn Veerasunthorn (story writer of â€˜Raya and the Last Dragonâ€™) â€” both of them have successful titles to their credit. Thematically, the film, which celebrates 100 years of Disney, seems to be inspired by the song â€˜When You Wish Upon a Starâ€™ that features in the 1940-film Pinocchio.

He tried to stand out within his family and other present crop of actors by choosing a low-key, literary adaptation Konda Polam next, followed by the family drama Ranga Ranga Vaibhavamgaa.

She denied that he received any preferential treatment in jail, and said that it was always in his interest to be well-behaved because otherwise, his furlough and parole wouldâ€™ve been denied.

Asked if he was â€˜too niceâ€™ a prisoner, she said in an interview with Cyrus Broacha on his podcast, â€œHe used his sources to find out that Iâ€™m from Punjab. He embarrassed me a little. But the main issue was the media alleging that we give him special treatment, which we did not. And he was nice generally because his parole and furlough was dependant on his behaviour in the prison. Had he not behaved, we would not have permitted him furlough or parole. Kaam bhi karta tha, beedi aur cigarette bhi khareed leta tha. On the whole, he had realised that here he had better behave.â€

It was this photo that convinced Sandeep that Bobby would be right for the part.

"Salman Khan has been a superstar since he appeared in his first role as a lead hero back in 1989â€™s Maine Pyar Kiya, yet the actor believes there is nothing â€˜superstarryâ€™ about him. In a recent interview, after the release of his latest film Tiger 3, Salman said that he has never felt like a superstar and shared that he has not stepped out to go for dinner in over 25 years.
In a chat with India Today, Salman said, â€œI have not stepped out of the house and gone for dinner in 25-26 years, or perhaps even more than that. I travel when I have to shoot. My only outdoor moment is when I sit in my lawn or then I go to the farm. My travel is home, shoot, hotel, airport, location, back home and then to the gym. Thatâ€™s it.â€

"Actor Vicky Kaushal recalled how they shot a key scene in his breakout movie Masaan, which was directed by Neeraj Ghaywan and written by Varun Grover. In an interview with Pinkvilla, Vicky said that several scenes in the indie movie were shot guerilla-style, meaning that they didnâ€™t have the proper permissions from authorities, but secretly got the footage they needed anyway. Vicky is no stranger to rogue productions, and famously got arrested as an assistant director while working on Anurag Kashyapâ€™s Gangs of Wasseypur.
A scene in which Vickyâ€™s character throws a ring into the river, the actor revealed, was shot impromptu with only Neeraj and cinematographer Avinash Arun present. He said that they had so little money at the time that he carried some of his own costumes in his suitcase. Vicky said that he wasnâ€™t supposed to cry in the famous â€˜dukh kahe khatam nahi hota beâ€™ scene, and Neeraj also filmed another scene in which the tears were actually scripted, just so that he could have options on the edit table later. But because they had some time to themselves, Neeraj decided that they should film the second scene without him crying.

"Vijay Varma has been enjoying a great time in showbiz as the actor has had many successful films and streaming shows in the last couple of years. Recently, during an interview, Vijay was asked if he wanted to emulate another actorâ€™s career and the actor said that he did not believe in following another personâ€™s path as every actor has their own unique journey. But he recalled the time when Tigmanshu Dhulia made him stand in front of Irrfan Khan and proclaimed Vijay as the next Irrfan.
Speaking to Galatta Plus, Vijay said, â€œI remember there was a Holi party at Tigmanshu Dhuliaâ€™s office. He held my hand and he was, of course, a little â€˜happyâ€™â€¦ He held my hand and made me walk up to Irrfan Khan, his face was fully coloured. He said â€˜Irrfan, he is going to take your placeâ€™ And I wanted to disappear from there. I just felt like this is the worst thing one person can tell another person. But Irrfan was totally having fun with that.â€

"Actor Vicky Kaushal recalled anecdotes about working on the film Sanju, in which he played the supporting character Kamli. Directed by Rajkumar Hirani, the film was based on the life of actor Sanjay Dutt, and starred Ranbir Kapoor in the lead role. In a new interview, Vicky admitted that he had a little to drink before shooting a scene with Paresh Rawal in which Kamli was supposed to be drunk.
Speaking to Pinkvilla, he also revealed that he stayed at a lodge in Surat for a few days, to pick up the mannerisms and language of Gujaratis. He said in Hindi, â€œI went to Gujarat by myself for a few days, and stayed at a lodge next to the railway station for three days. Five minutes away from the station, there is a lane where diamond traders operate. I was stunned to see people selling diamonds on the footpath; thatâ€™s when I realised how rich some people in our country are.â€

"Film producer and distributor Pahlajj Nihalani claimed that he launched filmmakers David Dhawan and Anees Bazmee in the industry, as he recalled a story about how they came back to him after turning down his proposal to work on the film Aankhen, starring Govinda and Chunky Panday. In an interview with Zoom Entertainment, Pahlajj said that in order to get them to return, he hosted an impromptu â€˜mahuratâ€™ event for a film without a script or a director, got Mahesh Bhatt to attend as a decoy, and then got David Dhawan and Anees Bazmee to sign on out of FOMO.
Narrating the story in Hindi, he said, â€œCoincidentally, Govinda and Chunky Panday came to visit me when I was unwell. They were enemies at the time, but they both wanted to work with me. I came up with an idea in two days, and we did the â€˜mahuratâ€™ before anybody even knew who the director was. At the â€˜mahuratâ€™, David asked me, â€˜Am I not doing the film?â€™ And I said, â€˜No, Mahesh Bhatt isâ€™.â€

"Ranbir Kapoor opened up about the loss of his father Rishi Kapoor in a recent interview and shared that he is yet to process the loss. Veteran actor Rishi Kapoor died in 2020 after a long battle with cancer. Ranbir shared that since a young age, boys are taught to be strong, and that is probably why he has still not expressed his grief even to himself.
Talking about his fatherâ€™s death on Unstoppable with NBK, Ranbir shared, â€œI think the loss of a parent is always the biggest low in a personâ€™s life. So when I lost my father a couple of years agoâ€¦ I donâ€™t think I have still understood the loss. Because you know being a sonâ€¦ since the time you are born, you are always taught to be strong. You donâ€™t express and say much. So I donâ€™t know if I have really expressed my fatherâ€™s loss yet to myself or to my loved ones.â€

"Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt have been together for six years now and just last year, the couple tied the knot and welcomed their daughter Raha. In a recent interview, Ranbir spoke about how â€œrelationships are hardâ€ and one has to constantly work at them to make a marriage work. The actor also shared that he and Alia are the complete opposite of each other when it comes to organising and keeping things tidy.
During his appearance on Unstoppable with NBK, Ranbir was asked about how a marriage between two popular actors works and he said, â€œWe have been together for six years now. I think in the first year you understand how to handle each otherâ€™s personality. Relationships are hard. Humans beings are very tough animals, very hard to understand. You have to understand the person. You have to have empathy for that person.â€

"The 1970s are monumental in the history of Hindi cinema. It was an era that saw the emergence of â€˜Angry Young Manâ€™ Amitabh Bachchan and introduced stalwarts like Vinod Khanna, Manoj Kumar and Shashi Kapoor to movie buffs. But it was also an era where ordinary and real characters, who went beyond stardom to strike a genuine chord with the audience, rubbed shoulders with these larger-than-life onscreen stars. And such characters were skillfully aced by Amol Palekar â€” a name Gen Z would have heard due to the comparisons drawn with Ayushmann Khurrana and Rajkummar Rao.
With expertise for all things beautiful and artistic, which probably came from his training as a painter at the JJ School of Art in Mumbai, and long experience as a theatre artist, Palekar found himself uniquely placed to embody fluid masculinity and be an alternative to the Alpha male of Hindi cinema in the 1970s and 1980s. He had a winsome smile which radiated optimism. He resembled a boy-next-door who had accidentally strayed onto a movie set, and that is exactly how Palekar became an actor.

"Film producer and distributor Pahlajj Nihalani bragged about never having narrated the story of a film to any actor in his career, forget having scripts. But he made an exception once, with Dharmendra. Recalling his experience working with Dharmendra on the 1987 film Aag Hi Aag, and said that the actor got â€˜annoyedâ€™ after being asked to give retakes.
In an interview with Zoom Entertainment, the producer said that when he tried to narrate a story to the late Sanjeev Kumar, the actor dismissed him, and said that he didnâ€™t need the know the story because he had faith in Pahlajj. He said in Hindi, â€œTo this day, Iâ€™ve never told the story to any actor Iâ€™ve cast, including my last film. I gave a general narration to only Dharam ji once, but it was only an outline. These days they have bound scripts, but back then, we would begin shooting with rough ideas.â€

"Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s fans were enthralled earlier this week by the first trailer for his upcoming film, Animal. A romantic crime drama directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga and co-starring Rashmika Mandanna, the film has been rated â€˜Aâ€™ by the Central Board of Film Certification, a tag that the team is wearing like a badge of honour. Vanga courted controversy with his first two films, Arjun Reddy and its Hindi remake Kabir Singh, and seems to be doubling down with Animal, which runs at nearly three-and-a-half hours long.
Vanga refused to compromise on the run time, after delivering a first cut that ran nearly four hours long. Long movies are significantly affected commercially, for the simple reason that distributors can fit fewer shows in a single day. Long movies rated â€˜Aâ€™ are further impacted. But Animal will be a true test not only for Vanga, but also for Ranbir who is slowly clawing his way back to the A-list after a mixed run since Sanju. Advance bookings for the film will begin in India on Sunday, November 26. According to the industry tracker Sacnilk, Animal is expected to generate Rs 50 crore on its opening day, which would easily be the biggest opening in Ranbirâ€™s career. Advance bookings began in the US, and according to Koimoi, the movie has sold only 3,200 tickets for 206 locations so far. But itâ€™s still very early days.

"Ranbir Kapoor, who is now promoting his upcoming release Animal, recently made an appearance on Unstoppable with NBK with Rashmika Mandanna. On the episode, Ranbir showed off his new tattoo on his collar bone with his daughterâ€™s name Raha. Ranbir and his wife-actor Alia Bhatt welcomed Raha Kapoor in November 2022.
Ranbir has previously gotten a tattoo in Hindi on his wrist. Shortly before the release of his film Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani, Ranbir got a tattoo that read â€˜Awaaraâ€™. The tattooâ€™s vibe matched with his character in the film who is shown to love his vagabond-like existence. Awaara was also the name of one of Raj Kapoorâ€™s most famous films. Ranbir is the grandson of Raj Kapoor. But a few years later, the actor said that he had no tattoos. When asked about tattoos, he told Mashable India in 2022, â€œNone yet. Hopefully soon. The 8 or something I donâ€™t know. Maybe my (tattoo is) going to be childrenâ€™s names or I donâ€™t know.â€

"Salman Khanâ€˜s Tiger 3 finally passed the Rs 250 crore at the domestic box office, after collecting Rs 4.7 crore on day 12 of release, according to industry tracker Sacnilk. While this is the starâ€™s best box office performance since 2017â€™s Tiger Zinda Hai, which it is trailing in the domestic market by Rs 80 crore. Tiger 3 is also trailing the Hrithik Roshan-starrer War by over Rs 130 crore domestically, and Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Pathaan by nearly Rs 300 crore.
The only film in YRFâ€™s Spy Universe that Tiger 3 has outperformed is the first one, Ek Tha Tiger, which was released over a decade ago.

"Veteran film Salim Khan was a well-known public figure who was at the peak of his career when he decided to do something that was looked down upon by a large part of the society. Salim was married to Salma Khan, and was the father of four children, when he fell in love again with actor Helen, and went on to marry her. Over the years, Salim has opened up about his relationships with his two wives and said that even though it was difficult to adjust for everyone in the initial days, they eventually got along with one another.
In an earlier interview with DNA, Salim spoke about Salma and Helen and called them â€˜good lookingâ€™ and shared, â€œIâ€™m lucky that I have two wives and that they live in harmony. Never mind if that happened a few years later. My wives are good-looking and now they are ageing gracefully.â€

"Adam Sandler voices a curmudgeonly (but chaotic) lizard named Leo in Netflixâ€™s new animated movie, co-directed by his old collaborator Robert Smigel. They previously worked together on a couple of those very successful Hotel Transylvania movies, whose zany humour Leo is also laced with. Neither a childrenâ€™s movie nor something that their parents can enjoy without rolling their eyes at least once, Leo exists in a limbo of its own making.
Having settled into a complacent existence in a fifth-grade classroom that he has called home since 1949, Leo and his best friend Squirtle (voiced by Bill Burr) have seen batch after batch of 10-year-olds come and go. This has made them experts in the field of child anthropology. In just one glance, for instance, Leo can tell if someone is an only child whoâ€™s never been told to shut up or an insecure urchin acting out because theyâ€™ve been bullied themselves. Leo hasnâ€™t ever taken an active interest in the childrenâ€™s lives, but his standoffish attitude is given an unexpected shake when he learns one day that he basically has one year left to live.

In a recent conversation, he candidly shared a pivotal moment in his career when financial strain led him to accept a role that didnâ€™t align with his artistic aspirations and her got fired from the project later.

They said there is a small reporterâ€™s role and itâ€™s a one-day job and you will get Rs 3000. I never wanted to play a role like that but I took it. I went and I started shooting.

"Salman Khanâ€™s much-anticipated action thriller, Tiger 3, experienced a robust opening at the box office, sparking high hopes for a blockbuster. However, after an initial surge, the filmâ€™s box office performance witnessed a significant decline. The fervour surrounding Tiger 3 dwindled during its second week, reflecting a struggle.

"The makers of Animal released the filmâ€™s trailer on Thursday. It shows Ranbir in an intense look as he plays the character of a young businessman who is on a mission to take revenge for an attack on his father. During the trailer launch event in Delhi, Ranbir revealed that his daughter Raha was born during the shoot of the film and since his character was demanding and intense, it was important for him to switch off when he went back home from the shoot.
He said, â€œThe switching on and switching off part was very important because when I was starting Animal, I became a father. Raha was born. I was going on set, doing all these things and going home and seeing my daughter was surreal. When youâ€™re inspired, aapka kaam aasani se ho jaata hai (When youâ€™re inspired, you are able to do your work easily). We wrapped the film in almost 100 days.â€

To this, Kay Kay replied, â€œI donâ€™t think so. First of all, the genesis of the word commercial is from commerce. So, what has done well is commercial.â€

One key reason is their tendency to adopt a preachy approach, assuming the intellectual inferiority of the general public. Instead of allowing viewers to immerse themselves in a story and draw their own conclusions, these films tend to dictate the message.
Another issue lies in the setting. Often, when discussing topics such as sexual orientation and/or feminism, stories unfold in urban/elite environments with convenient narrative choices, wherein even initially problematic or elderly characters eventually shift to the right side expressing solidarity after the main characters deliver a â€˜powerfulâ€™ speech. This approach un/intentionally implies that only the rich, educated or upper caste/class are likely to understand such matters and be open to changing their perspectives. But what happens when these matters arise in common households, in the lives of ordinary people who constitute a larger portion of the population? How would/should a working-class family respond to a member coming out?

"To celebrate Salman Khan and Katrina Kaifâ€™s latest film Tiger 3 release on Diwali, fans burst crackers inside a theatre in Malegaon in Maharashtra as they watched the film. The incident circulated on social media, prompting Salman Khan to address and criticize the act on Instagram.
In a recent interview with Times Now, the actor labelled the bursting of firecrackers in theatres as â€œnot cool,â€ emphasising the potential danger and risk associated with it. He admitted that fans were excited for the filmâ€™s release, but the act of bursting crackers inside a theatre can be very risky. He expressed concern over deteriorating air quality and urged his fans to refrain from worsening it further. He said, â€œThe most dangerous thing one can do is burst firecrackers in theatres.â€

"Babil Khan says he was grappling with the loss of his father, actor Irrfan Khan when he started working on the Netflix show The Railway Men and credits his co-star Kay Kay Menon for creating an environment where he felt a sense of belonging.
During a press conference at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) here on Wednesday evening, the actor revealed he had started working on the series about seven-eight months after his fatherâ€™s demise.
Irrfan, a highly acclaimed and internationally renowned actor, passed away in April 2020 after a battle with a rare form of cancer.

Babil, who made his debut with the Netflix movie Qala and also starred in the streamerâ€™s recent release Friday Night Plan, said he found solace on the set of The Railway Men.

â€œWhen I was working with Kay Kay sir on this series, I was going through a huge loss. I had lost my best friend and father in one day. It was seven or eight months before we started shooting for this,â€ the young actor told PTI here.
â€œWhen I would arrive on the set, that was the only time I felt like I belonged anywhere. When I was working with Kay Kay sir, that was the only time in that period of my life when I felt like I belonged. I think, to make a human being believe that they belong is the greatest gift you can give to them,â€ he added.
Menon, a contemporary of Irrfan and co-star of critically acclaimed titles like â€œHaiderâ€ and â€œLife in aâ€¦ Metro,â€ praised Babil and said the upcoming actor possesses qualities that will take him to â€œgreat heightsâ€.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œBabil is an individual in himself, and he has something that will take him to great heights. Once you have seen the series, you will realise that. For him, to preserve and maintain that spark of Irrfan is his journey.

â€œAnd thatâ€™s what I felt about him since I worked so closely with him. He is a man of the heart, and he will go a long way,â€ the star said.
The Railway Men, the first series from Yash Raj Filmsâ€™ digital arm YRF Entertainment, directed by debutant Shiv Rawail, has received rave reviews since its premiere on Netflix last week.
Set against the backdrop of the 1984 Bhopal gas leak tragedy, the show pays tribute to the unsung heroes, the Indian railway employees posted at Bhopal station, who saved hundreds of innocent lives during that fateful night. It also stars R Madhavan and Divyenndu.
ADVERTISEMENT
In the initial phase of his career, Menon said he had worked on a story about the industrial disaster â€” in 1999â€™s Bhopal Express â€” but what made him take up the series was the fact that it highlighted the sacrifices of the railway employees.
â€œWhat drew me to this script was the banner of â€˜The Railway Menâ€™, which was unique as far as the series is concerned. This script gave space to those heroes who are unknown,â€ he added.
The actor believes people tend to â€œunderestimateâ€ the Indian Railways.
â€œWe sit in a train and take them for granted, not knowing that it is a high-risk job that they are doing. It is very easy to pass snide remarks, but it is a high-precision and high-risk job. Their job is not just to take you from A to B but to take you there safely. So, itâ€™s an added responsibility,â€ Menon said.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œSo for me, when I chose to do this series, it was my homage to this particular organisation (Indian Railways) that we all take for granted, especially those railway men who sacrificed themselves to save people on that fateful night,â€ he added. IFFI will conclude on November 28."
"Superstar Amitabh Bachchan is known to stay in touch with his social media fans or â€˜Extended Familyâ€™ as he calls them. He often updates his blog late at night and sometimes tweets at midnight as well. During his recent episode of Kaun Banega Crorepati Junior, he was asked by a young contestant if his family members scolded him for using social media so late in the night.
Amitabh was playing the game with 12-year-old Arjun Tambadiya from Rajkot when the young contestant posed an interesting question to the superstar quiz master. He asked Amitabh, â€œYou tweet so late at night. Doesnâ€™t Jaya Madam, Abhishek bhaiya scold you?â€

"As an actor, Ranbir Kapoor has no limitations, says filmmaker Sandeep Reddy Vanga, who believes he has presented the star in a never-seen-before avatar in their upcoming film Animal.
The movie revolves around a father and son and their troubled bond, played by Anil Kapoor and Ranbir. It is set against the backdrop of extreme bloodshed in the underworld.
The director, known for Vijay Devarakonda-starrer Arjun Reddy and its Hindi remake Kabir Singh, starring Shahid Kapoor, said it was a pleasure to watch Kapoor transform into the total antithesis of himself in the role of Arjun Singh in Animal.

â€œRanbir is a great actor, he is in a different league altogether. He is very original. I feel he is a mix of so many actors, it is wrong to compare to other actors, (But) I feel he is a mix of Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Kamal Haasan. This man (Ranbir) has no limitation,â€ Vanga says.
He adds, â€œHe doesnâ€™t get angry like his character (in the film). He is a very calm person. I remember when I used to write rageful scenes, I would ask him so many times, â€˜Ranbir, when do you get angry?â€™ He would say, â€˜I donâ€™t get angry, and Sandeep this is the 7th or 9th time you are asking me thisâ€™.â€
Vanga says he was introduced to Kapoorâ€™s work through Rockstar, in which the actor played the role of a musician struggling to find himself, spiritually and artistically.
â€œI saw two shows of Rockstar on the same day. I loved him and I told him about this. I never thought I would get to work with him. As a concept film, this is my second film. Iâ€™m glad I got to work with him this early. He had called me saying, â€˜We should work (together)â€™. This is after Kabir Singh,â€ Vanga says.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œHe had actually sent me a text message after Arjun Reddy, and I had not seen his message as it came from an unknown number. It was such a mistake. I was so happy when I learnt about it.â€ The movie also stars Bobby Deol and Rashmika Mandanna.
Speaking about Bobby Deol, Vanga said Deol was always the first choice for the movie.
â€œHe is a great guy. From day one, we had Bobby in mind. I had called him in 2020 or 2021, he was promoting Class of 83. For one of the scenes where he is bare-chested, we shot it in Scotland in minus three degrees. He came, he did the shot,â€ he added.
Produced by Kumar and Krishan Kumarâ€™s T-Series, Murad Khetaniâ€™s Cine1 Studios and Pranay Reddy Vangaâ€™s Bhadrakali Pictures, Animal will release theatrically on December 1 in Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and Malayalam.
ADVERTISEMENT
Vanga is happy with the reception the movieâ€™s teaser has received and said he is eager to see how the public will react when â€œAnimalâ€ opens in theatres next month.
â€œIâ€™m so happy that everybody is liking it. I gave more than three years for this film. It all feels good when people like your work. I think the film will be a blockbuster. Itâ€™s been a while since there has been a story about father and son,â€ he said.

The two actors are yet to star in a film together but have appeared in significant cameos in each otherâ€™s films â€“ Tiger 3 and Pathaan.

"After unveiling a teaser some weeks ago, followed by several songs that revealed more footage from the movie, T-Series has now released the first trailer for the hotly anticipated Animal. Directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga and starring Ranbir Kapoor in the lead role, the film has been described as a romantic crime thriller, and is proudly wearing its adults-only tag. In Animal, Ranbir plays the scion of a business family, who goes on a hyper-violent revenge mission his beloved father is attacked.
The trailer begins with Ranbir Kapoor and Anil Kapoorâ€™s characters play-acting a memory from the past. This exchange highlights the toxic dynamic that they share, but also establishes the intensity with which the protagonist hero worships his dad. As the years go by, Ranbirâ€™s character starts acting out, much to the concern of his parents. After his dad is attacked, Ranbirâ€™s character vows to never leave his familyâ€™s side, and swears vengeance. Itâ€™s like The Godfather, but with a Punjabi rap video aesthetic.

"Actor Shah Rukh Khan felt the audiencesâ€™ unconditional love this year, as millions showed up to watch his back-to-back blockbuster films Pathaan and Jawan. Shah Rukh had once spoken about how important films are to him, as they keep him from losing his mind. In an old interview, Shah Rukh had said that â€˜making films is the only way I know to get over sadnessâ€™. And the sadness that he was referring to was the death of his parents.
Shah Rukh was only a teenager when his father passed away at the age of 52. And then, some years later, his mother died as well, also at the age of 52. Shah Rukh spoke fondly about his parents in the 2004 BBC documentary The Inner World of Shah Rukh Khan, and said that losing them left his sister psychologically wrecked. â€œMy sister lives with me. She is five years elder to me. She was a very brilliant student, a very educated girl. Strangely, a trained psychologist. Unfortunately, sheâ€™s not very well. She got very disturbed with my parentsâ€™ death,â€ Shah Rukh said.

"Nearly two weeks after the release of Tiger 3, Salman Khan is speaking to the media in what should have been a victory lap, but is coming across as a last-ditch effort to get more audiences to watch the film. Tiger 3 has made nearly Rs 250 crore at the domestic box office, and Rs 400 crore worldwide, but has been sluggish in recent days following a strong opening.
But because heâ€™s required to be out and about these days, paparazzi videos of him have also been flooding the internet. After entertaining fans and the media at a recent Tiger 3 celebration event in Mumbai, the actor was spotted at the Mumbai airport recently, surrounded by his longtime bodyguard Shera and a horde of armed officials. Salman was granted Y-Plus category security by the Maharashtra government earlier this year, after threats were made to his life. He also travels around Mumbai in a special bulletproof vehicle.

"Varun Dhawan and Sidharth Malhotra were the guests on the latest episode of Koffee with Karan, hosted by Karan Johar and the duo tried to stay as far away from controversies as possible. Koffee with Karan has a mischievous reputation as the previous seasons of the show have landed celebrities in trouble for being too candid while expressing their opinions. Keeping that in mind, Varun and Sidharth were extremely cautious about what they spoke on the show.
When Karan asked them if they thought this show â€œpeople into trouble,â€ the two actors said yes in unison. Varun then elaborated that his film producers, who are currently working with, were actually scared of his appearance on the show. â€œI have producers working with me who are scared,â€ he said. Sidharth elaborated that Varun got a 15 minute lecture from a producer about how Varun should be extremely careful on the show. â€œWe were at the last partyâ€¦ there was a 15 minute long conversation/lecture, more to him (points to Varun),â€ Sidharth said.

That being said, Sidharth claimed that it doesnâ€™t take too long for him and Varun to get back to where they left off whenever they meet now. â€œWhenever we meet at a party, even recently, the first line doesnâ€™t have to be about hi, hello, how are you, it becomes about something else,â€ he said.

"Salman Khanâ€˜s Tiger 3 might be his biggest hit in six years, but itâ€™s still being seen as an under-performer considering its massive budget and expectations. On its 11th day of release, the film made Rs 5.7 crore across all languages in India, registering another marginal day-to-day drop. In total, Tiger 3 has made Rs 249 crore domestically, according to industry tracker Sacnilk.
Produced for a reported Rs 300 crore, the film had a large opening on Diwali, which happened to be a Sunday. It made Rs 44 crore, and seemed to be doing just fine until Bhai Dooj a couple of days later. But since then, it has struggled to maintain a steady pace at the box office, and was further hurt by Team Indiaâ€™s progress at the 2023 Menâ€™s Cricket World Cup. The filmâ€™s daily collections dropped below the Rs 20 crore mark by day five, and below the Rs 10 crore mark by day nine.

The architect of the 1963 March on Washington, best known outside the United States as the venue for Martin Luther King Jrâ€™s â€œI have a dreamâ€ speech, Rustin channeled all his personal angst as a gay Black man and a fiercely passionate social reformer into the movement. Unfortunately, director George C Wolfeâ€™s by-the-numbers biopic is the very shot glass in which its star, Colman Domingo, finds himself trapped.
Long overdue for a role like this, Domingo is by far the best thing about the movie, which, as you unfortunately grow to learn over its hour-and-a-half run-time, isnâ€™t exactly a flattering comparison. His performance highlights the charismatic eccentricity of Rustin, whose long battle for equality unfolded mostly behind-the-scenes. Despite his immense contributions, he remains an underrepresented figure in history textbooks, some of which he is apparently being written out of. And itâ€™s thanks in part to executive producers Barack and Michelle Obama that Rustin was able to get off the ground.

"Filmmaker Vetrimaaran, known for his nuanced take on pertinent social issues through films such as Asuran, Vada Chennai and Visaranai, says he is aware of the expectations that viewers have from him but he tries to stay away from the hype surrounding his work.
Vetrimaaran presented his latest film Viduthalai: Part One at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) here on Wednesday.
â€œIâ€™m not responsible for the expectation and the hype, and Iâ€™m not working on it or creating it. I donâ€™t have Twitter (now X). I was on Facebook but Iâ€™m happy someone hacked my account. So Iâ€™m trying to keep myself intact,â€ Vetrimaaran told reporters at a press conference here.

But there are times when the pressure gets to him, the filmmaker admitted.
â€œSometimes, it does put a pressure unconsciously when Iâ€™m working on the final cut. During the release, I find it really hard to sleep. It is an unconscious stress. But once the film is over, I get out of it. I donâ€™t watch my films after the release or read reviews,â€ he said.

Viduthalai: Part One, starring Vijay Sethupathi, Soori, Gautham Vasudev Menon and Bhavani Sre, is part of the Indian Panaroma lineup at the festival.
Vidhuthalai is set in 1987 in Tamil Nadu and follows the police crackdown on The Peopleâ€™s Army, an armed anti-government outfit, that poses a big threat to the stability of the government in the region.

It follows Kumaresan (Soori), a new police recruit, who feels conflicted by the actions of police.
Vetrimaaran said he wanted to make a quick film during the COVID pandemic .
â€œThis story I chose to write the script on was a novel written by B Jeyamohan and it was called Thunaivan. I assumed that the rights would be with him to give it to me. I started working on the script. And then halfway through, I realised that I should ask him first. I called him and asked him and he said he had given it to someone else.â€ After that, he reworked the script along with Jeyamohan.
â€œSo initially, my idea was to make a film on a police outpost in a forest where three people are working, and one guy brings in food and goes away. So it was supposed to be only in that outpost. But then I started working backwards. there is one guy who brings food every day for these people. Let me follow him, follow his journey into this worldâ€¦He gets to understand the difference between what is said and what exists and through him we also get to understand the world, the people and the politics,â€ he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Vetrimaaran said the film is still a work in progress and he is currently shooting for part two.
â€œWhen I watched the film, I know that it has gone wrong here, then Iâ€™m thinking, â€˜Okay, Iâ€™ll have to rectify it in the second part.â€™ So itâ€™s still a work in progress,â€ he added.
The filmmaker also decoded his process of working on a story and how it differs from adapting a novel.
â€œIf I decide to make a story around a particular group of people or a geographical scape, then I go there and see the people and the place. I work there for one or two years to understand the place and the people..â€
ADVERTISEMENT
If the story doesnâ€™t work for him, then the filmmaker starts working on it all over again.
â€œThis is a long process. Whereas a novelist or a story writer has done all the research for me and put it into the novel. He has condensed his lifeâ€™s work into few hundred pages or even less,â€ he said.

Vetrimaaran, 48, also talked about why he decided to rope in actor Soori for the main role in Vidhuthalai Part 1. The actor was earlier known for comedic parts in many Tamil films.
â€œWhen I want to do a film with someone, then I need to understand what kind of person this actor is and that is very important, especially when you are putting an actor in a zone they are not used to.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œIdeally, I want them to be themselves in front of the camera. I donâ€™t want them to be someone else they are not from within. Soori comes across as a very simple personâ€¦ Sooriâ€™s personality seeped into the character when I was writing the script,â€ the director said."
"As someone who started acting when she was just a teenager, actor Katrina Kaif says she is very driven and competitive but over the years, she has learned to enjoy the â€œwonderful journeyâ€ she has had in Hindi cinema.
There are many films that helped her grow, says Katrina, who completed 20 years in Bollywood this year. She counts New York, Mere Brother Ki Dulhan, Rajneeti, Singh is Kinng, Namastey London, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara and Zero among major milestones in her career.
â€œIâ€™ve been really fortunate and because Iâ€™m such a driven person, Iâ€™m constantly looking around me. You compare yourself, it is but natural because if you are a very driven and competitive person, you never rest with yourself. You are always pushing yourselfâ€¦ But sometimes I remind myself to take that moment to think and appreciate that Iâ€™ve been given so much and Iâ€™ve earned it as well. It has been a wonderful journey that Iâ€™m very grateful for,â€ Katrina Kaif told PTI in an interview.

The actor said she has always been â€œobsessiveâ€ about her work to the point where it has become her identity. She also said she finds acting to be an extremely demanding career.
â€œI believe personally itâ€™s the demand of the profession, (that) you have to be consumed with your craft as an actor. If you are not consumed with the film, I think the gap shows somewhere on screen. Also, I think itâ€™s my nature. Iâ€™m very obsessive about things when it comes to my work. I get consumed by it so much, people have to tell me, â€˜Go home, everyoneâ€™s tired nowâ€™.
â€œI guess my work has been my identity. I started when I was very young. Before I was 17-year-old, I had started my career and when something gives you your identity then that becomes part of your core, that becomes who you are. You are always tuned and trained to kind of inherently fight for that and protect that,â€ she added.

When asked what advice she would give to her younger selfâ€”who is about to embark on her acting careerâ€”Katrina Kaif replied, â€œEnjoy the moment.â€
â€œI had a great timeâ€¦ I was having a blast. I look back at those moments and I had so much fun. The only thing maybe, I can tell myself, â€˜Enjoy this momentâ€™ because in those days there was no social media so we just stayed in the moment.â€
Post Tiger 3, Kaif has three films in pipeline including Sriram Raghavan-directed thriller Merry Christmas, Jee Le Zaara co-starring Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Alia Bhatt, and a film as well with director Alia Abbas Zafar.
Katrina Kaif said she is excited for the future and what it holds for her as an actor.

â€œIâ€™m very happy as long as Iâ€™m making choices that are honest to who Iâ€™m today. Iâ€™m making choices from a balanced and calm place, a happy space, so thatâ€™s always good. (Iâ€™m) excited for the future. Excited to see how I can evolve as an artiste. What new dimension I can bring on screen and what new dimension I can bring to my work. I am looking forward to that,â€ she added.

"Ronit Roy worked with Hrithik Roshan in the 2017 film Kaabil. In a recent interview, Ronit recalled the time he spent with Hrithik on the shoot of the film. Ronit said that although he had known the actor for many years, he had never worked with the star so when he landed up on set, he found it best to address him as â€˜sirâ€™. But this didnâ€™t go well with Hrithik as he objected to it the next day.
â€œI was cast in a film where he is the star so you donâ€™t really know what to do so you take the safe route. So I said, â€˜Good morning, sir.â€™ He is the lead of the film so the safest way is to call him sir,â€ Ronit shared with Lehren Retro. The actor said that he had spent time with Hrithik before but the two had actually never worked together. He recalled that the after the first day went by, Hrithik called him to his van the next day.

"Salman Khanâ€™s Tiger 3 has worked majorly in favour of the Bollywood star who was going through a rough patch. The third installment in the Tiger franchise will soon cross the Rs 250-crore mark in India, but it might not repeat the success of Pathaan, Gadar 2 and Jawan. This week, the movie has struggled to cross the Rs 10 crore mark, earning Rs 7.35 crore and Rs 6.70 crore on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. According to early estimates (posted at 10 pm) by industry tracker Sacnilk, the film has collected on Rs 5.75 crore on Wednesday. This brings the Indian box office collection of Tiger 3 to Rs 249.70 crore.
Meanwhile, the movie has crossed the Rs 400-crore mark worldwide, which has brought joy to Salmanâ€™s fans, who have been waiting for such a hit from the star for a while now.

"Heâ€™s still â€œjust a guy on a stoolâ€ for whom the audienceâ€™s laughter will always be more precious than accolades, says Vir Das, the first Indian comic to win an International Emmy Award.
Das won the award for his Netflix stand-up special Vir Das: Landing in the best comedy category at a ceremony in New York on Monday night. He tied with the much acclaimed British series Derry Girls for the coveted prize.
â€œThe job is to take the beautiful chosen people of the world and humanise them a little bit by making an idiot out of myselfâ€¦ I hope we all just get sillier and continue to be fools,â€ the actor-comic, who returned home on Wednesday, told PTI in a virtual interview.
ADVERTISEMENT
The future of the Indian comedy scene is â€œtremendousâ€, the 41-year-old said.

â€œIâ€™m underslept. The phone has been going a little insane. But Iâ€™m just grateful. I donâ€™t think anything has fully sunk in yet. Luckily, I have a long flight back to India to process all of it.â€
An award, he said, is a gift and recognition laughter.
â€œIn my speech, I made sure to thank the Indian people for their laughter. I said it was the soundtrack to my life,â€ he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Injecting a note of reality as he celebrates his first International Emmy trophy, Vir Das said it will get him â€œmaybe 30 seconds extra applauseâ€ when he walks out on the stage. After that, it will only be about the laughs.
â€œI will have to make them (the audience) laugh. At the end of the day, they will be like, â€˜We have paid for this, so make us laugh.'â€
Das, who has often courted trouble over his quirky, observational performances and social media posts, is already readying for shows in Chandigarh and Bengaluru.
He was one of the three Indians to be nominated at the 51st International Emmy Awards along with Shefali Shah for Delhi Crime season two (Netflix) and Jim Sarbh for Rocket Boys (SonyLIV). Besides, producer Ektaa R Kapoor of Balaji Productions was honoured with the International Emmy Directorate Award.

The comic said there was â€œa bit of suspenseâ€ at the awards gala when the winner for best comedy category was going to be announced because two envelopes made an appearance on the stage all of a sudden.

â€œI tied with â€˜Derry Girlsâ€™, one of the best shows in the world,â€ he added.

That they were surprised to hear their name called out is generally a cliched response but the comedian said he only went to the International Emmy Awards with the intent to root for Shefali Shah, who was vying for a win in the best performance by an actress category. She was bested by Karla Souza of La Caida, a Mexican show.
â€œI really considered my job to be there to root for Shefali. She is a once-in-a-generation talentâ€¦ I was just kind of focusing my energy on her. I was genuinely surprised (when I won).
â€œAs much as Netflix India is gigantic and has a worldwide footprint, Iâ€™m still just a guy on a stool. So, to be in a category with Derry Girls, which is a massive Netflix show, itself is an achievement. So, when they said (the winner is) Vir Das: Landing, I was very, very surprised,â€ he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Vir Das kind of fumbled his way up to the stage, but he got his thank yous right which was very important.
â€œI said many things. The second I got off the stage, I panicked (wondering) did I thank everyone? I hope I didnâ€™t mess it up. (I said to myself) No, you thanked your wife, your family, Netflix and everybody who worked on it.â€
Vir Das: Landing is Dasâ€™ fourth special with Netflix. This was his second nod at the International Emmys; first one, also with the streamer, was for Vir Das: For India in 2021.
Through Vir Das: Landing, the aim was to tell the world what his â€œidea of homeâ€ is, the comic said.
ADVERTISEMENT
He was born in Dehradun and spent the first 14 years of his life in Lagos, Nigeria. He has also lived in Haryana, Delhi-NCR, and the US.
Das, who is now based out of Mumbai, said he is fortunate to be a â€œglobal Indian comedy voiceâ€.
â€œI get to travel the world. Itâ€™s a tremendous privilege. What that comes with is I spend eight months a year missing home sometimes during a world tour. The germ of the show is from there. I miss home and a lot of times if Iâ€™m in New York or London, there are 3,000 people in the room, out of which 1,500 are Indians who havenâ€™t been in a room with so many Indians in a really long time. You are their catch-up, their update with home. Thatâ€™s what the central feeling of the show was. I donâ€™t think there could be a better stage for the show to get some love than an international stage,â€ he said.
His win comes almost a month after the sudden demise of popular American actor and comedian Matthew Perry. The late actor is best known for the popular 1990s sitcom Friends, in which he played the iconic role of socially awkward but amiable Chandler Bing who uses sarcasm to get by in life.
ADVERTISEMENT
Das, who had shared a heartfelt tribute for Perry on social media after his passing, said the Friends star essayed his part like a lovable fool.
â€œThe jesterâ€™s job, the jokerâ€™s job, the foolâ€™s job is to make fun of people to make them seem beautiful. Thatâ€™s what Matthew Perry did very well in a scene. He made the other person look good by being how silly he could be.â€
Vir Das, also known for films such as Go Goa Gone, Delhi Belly, and Love Aaj Kal, has several acting projects lined up for 2024.
â€œI just wrapped up a show which should be out soonâ€¦ I co-directed a feature that goes on floor in February that Iâ€™ll star in. It will be my co-directorial debut of sorts. I should have an American piece of content out soon too. It (2024) is an acting year, a heavy acting year,â€ he said.

The actor might hit a hattrick this year with three hits in a row with the release of Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s Dunki, since he already has registered hits with Pathaan and Jawan. He will also be witnessing the grand debut of his daughter Suhana Khan in Zoya Akhtarâ€™s The Archies. Suhana has been an aspiring actor for a few years now and has studied acting as well. In The Archies, Suhana is playing Veronica and fans are expecting the same kind of magic from her, as they have been seeing from SRK for the last 30 years.

"Seldom does Mani Ratnam get candid and share his perspectives about things as he belongs to the breed of filmmakers for whom â€˜film does the talkingâ€™. However, in a recent round table interaction, the filmmaker shared his two cents about the ongoing obsession with box office numbers among the audience.
The round table, organised by Galatta Plus, was attended by Mani Ratnam, Vetrimaaran, Mari Selvaraj, Sudha Kongara, Madonne Ashwin, and PS Vinothraj. They were asked their opinion on the trend of casting big stars to mint moolah at the box office. Vetrimaaran said that post COVID, the market has changed and audiences want to come to theatres only for big star films. He added that it is good for the market and cinema as it generates a lot of money in the industry which increases the salary of everyone.
However, he noted that the lifetime collection of a film like his Viduthalai will not even be as much as the opening day collection of a big starâ€™s film. â€œWhen we invest Rs 10 crore, why do we want it to do Rs 100 crore? Why canâ€™t we be happy with Rs 15 crore or Rs 18 crore?â€ he said.

Mani Ratnam, on the other hand, was disappointed that the box office has become a subject for the audience. â€œWhat is a bit disappointing is that, including the audience, everyone is talking about numbers. Is it a good film or a bad film? Did you enjoy it or not? Is it relevant? Is it required for us to grow? The discussions have gone beyond all thisâ€
Mari Selvaraj, however, interrupted and said that he is not sure whether audiences are discussing numbers. â€œI donâ€™t think in places like Thirunelveli, they discuss number. For them, it is just about whether the film is good or not.â€ Ratnam laughed and said, â€œThatâ€™s a good news.â€  Selvaraj added that the whole debate around box office collection that happens on social media is forced."
"Casting director Mukesh Chhabra says working on Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s upcoming feature Dunki starring Shah Rukh Khan was an unforgettable experience, as he got to work on a project which he feels will be remembered for years to come.

"Kiara Advani and Sidharth Malhotra did not make their relationship public until they tied the knot earlier this year but during Sidharthâ€™s appearance on Koffee with Karan, Karan Johar and Varun Dhawan spoke about the love story that was hidden from the world for the longest time. Karan recalled that he once threw a party which was being attended by both Sid and Kiara, even though they were in a fight with each other.
Karan recalled that as they sat with each other and made up, he was certain that they were meant to be together. â€œI remember they (Sidharth and Kiara) were having a fight, he was having a high fever, and he had come to my party. But it was very sweet, because two hours later they were sitting together and she was feeding him. At that point, I realised that this is going to happen, they are going to happen,â€ he said.
Varun Dhawan also recalled the incident where Kiara was quite excited to see Sidharth and he wondered whatâ€™s cooking between the two as Sid had high fever at the time but he was still making the effort to come and see her. He shared, â€œExactly, we were shooting a song, we finished shooting and we were heading back. She (Kiara) was so happy, like Sid is going to come there, bechara he has a high fever. She had told me you were unwell. Someone was telling me that Sidharth with a high fever coming to a party to meet a girl matlab kuch toh hai yaar (that means there is something).â€
Sidharth Malhotra and Kiara Advani starred together in the Vikram Batra biopic Shershah that got them a lot of acclaim for their performances. Sidharth and Kiara got married in February 2023 at Jaisalmerâ€™s Suryagarh Palace in the company of close friends and family.

Similarly, Sunnyâ€™s father Dharmendra and brother Bobby Deol made a mark with their roles in films Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani and Animal, respectively.

Drawing inspiration from yesteryear actors, including his father, who did back-to-back films without extensive preparation, Sunny labeled such research as â€œgibberish.â€ He emphasised that, except for biographical characters, he prefers interpreting roles in his unique way without meticulous research.
The actor went on to reveal that he doesnâ€™t have dialogues of his films as he is dyslexic. He shared that he canâ€™t read and write properly. He also shed light on the challenges he faced in his academic journey. He said, â€œEarlier, we didnâ€™t know what it was, and people would think..ki yeh duffer aadmi hai.â€ Sunny shared that he navigates his dyslexia by receiving his dialogues in Hindi, meticulously reading them multiple times to internalise and deliver them in the front of the camera.

Earlier, in an interview with Ranveer Allahbadia, Sunny had shared how he would also often get â€œslappedâ€ for not scoring well in studies, but no one really knew what dyslexia event meant back then.
He said, â€œI was dyslexic as a child. Back then, we didnâ€™t even know what that meant! Thappad padte the, duffer hai, padhai nahi aati (I would get slapped, called duffer for not being able to study). Even now when it comes to reading, sometimes the words seem all jumbled up. Often people say to use a teleprompter (at public gathering) but I refuse! I am like, â€˜You tell me what to say, I will try to say it.â€™â€

"Right after India lost the World Cup final to Australia, I found my heartbroken husband looking for videos of Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli from the tournament. It was an unusual sight considering he has never shown an interest in actors, let alone their personal lives, and second, he judges those of us who do. Yet, he was captivated by this couple, and especially Anushka, who didnâ€™t just blew flying kisses to her husband when he scored his 50th century but also embraced him tightly when he sought solace after the final defeat. Talk about couple goals!
But why do Virat and Anushka come across as the perfect couple every time the camera captures them? After all, there are other equally famous and revered Bollywood jodis. There can be no single answer to this question. Itâ€™s perhaps how they articulate their relationship in interviews and how fans align their words with actions caught on camera.

"Actor Ranbir Kapoor has breached Rs 700 cr globally. The actorâ€™s latest action thriller drama Animal is re-writing box office records with even its domestic collections inching closer to the coveted Rs 500 cr club, which only Shah Rukh Khan and Sunny Deol have cracked so far in Bollywood.
According to industry tracker Sacnilk, Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Animal netted Rs 37 cr in all languages on its second Sunday. The ten-day total of the film now stands at Rs 432.37 cr. Animalâ€™s worldwide gross is Rs 717.46 crore.

Animal has had a better second Sunday than both Shah Rukh blockbusters, Pathaan and Jawan. While the former did Rs 28.5 cr, the latter netted Rs 36.85 cr. But in terms of total collections after second weekend, Animal is already ahead of Pathaan. Animalâ€™s collection on its second weekend stands at Rs 87.56 crore, which is a record in itself.

Pathaan stood at Rs 429.9 cr (which was its day 12) after second Sunday, a number Animal has already surpassed. But Jawan was way ahead at Rs 477 cr after its second weekend (which was the filmâ€™s 11th day).

The film, despite coming under fire for its misogyny and excessive violence, is trending at an excellent pace at the box office and will now target to break the record of Gadar 2, which was Rs 525 cr. The film now has a free 10-day run, before Shah Rukhâ€™s third film of the year, Dunki arrives. A day later, on December 22, Prabhasâ€™ actioner Salaar will hit cinemas.
Before the screens are considerably reduced due to the big Christmas releases, Animal will hope to make as much money as possible and eventually target the records of Pathaan (Rs 543 all India) and Jawan (Rs 640 cr all India).

"Marathi filmmaker Chhatrapal Ninaweâ€™s debut feature Ghaath (Ambush) was screened at the ongoing 28th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK) in Thiruvananthapuram on Saturday night.
A film that underwent significant hurdles before its world premiere at the 73rd Berlin International Film Festival in February this year, Ghaath revolves around the tense interplay between Maoist guerrillas, civilians and the police in Indian forests.

After garnering positive reviews at Berlinale, the film made its way to Kerala for a screening at the IFFK as part of the Indian Cinema Now category. However, during the screening at the Kalabhavan Theatre in Thiruvananthapuram late Saturday night, some unfortunate incidents occurred and the director expressed complete dissatisfaction with the projection and sound quality in the hall.
ADVERTISEMENT
Following the film screening, a Q&A session was scheduled at the theatre, and Ninawe, who was present there while the film was being played as well, took the opportunity to criticise how the film had been presented.
  View this post on Instagram
  A post shared by Platoon One Films (@platoononefilms)
â€œI am thankful to the viewers for staying through the entire premiere, as I might not have done the same. I came to IFFK with great expectations, but the projection quality was disappointingly poor and the sound quality was the worst I have ever encountered. Itâ€™s such a shame. It doesnâ€™t matter that you provided me with accommodation at a big hotel. I am ready to sleep even on the floor. However, compromising on screening quality is unacceptable,â€ he said, addressing the viewers before storming out of the hall.
Speaking to The Indian Express, Chhatrapal Ninawe reiterated his dissatisfaction, stating, â€œI believe this theatre has an incredible legacy, and these issues are easily fixable. Itâ€™s unfortunate that they werenâ€™t addressed. My sound designer (Manoj M Goswami) worked on the Baahubali movies, so you can imagine how meticulously we crafted Ghaathâ€™s sound. Itâ€™s unfortunate that the audience couldnâ€™t fully experience it.â€
At the outset, the theatre also had to briefly halt the screening and restart the projection as the wrong aspect ratio was initially chosen.
KSFDC is the sole production agency for documentary film and video programmes for the Government of Kerala."
"Just when you believe youâ€™ve unravelled a character in this film and understood their true nature, they utter something incredibly banal or logical, completely shattering your perceptions of them. Itâ€™s only after a certain point that we realise they are like us and we are like them â€” taking stances and forming opinions based on convenience and how much of ours is at stake.
Thereâ€™s no simple way to describe Anand Ekarshiâ€™s debut feature Aattam (The Play), which was recently screened at the 28th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK). At its core, the film revolves around a woman who faces sexual assault in a space she had considered safe. Simultaneously, it is about a group of men who come together to â€˜discussâ€™ or â€˜investigateâ€™ the matter. At the same time, it is also about the insensitivity with which a patriarchal society responds to such cases. The film also exposes male hypocrisy and how men, ultimately, wield influence even in matters they lack understanding of. It also highlights the issue of men not knowing when to shut up and the denial of opportunities for women to speak. Aattam, simultaneously, shows how the burden consistently falls on women to prove the authenticity of their experiences, whereas men often receive a free pass without needing any explanations. Aattam is both a play and a movie, like KG Georgeâ€™s all-time classic Yavanika (1982). It is also a play within a play within a movie. The film can be likened to a courtroom drama too, albeit sans a courtroom. However, above all, it stands out as one of the most brilliant Malayalam movies in recent times.

"The origin story of Ronit Royâ€™s 2.0 phase can be traced back to his car, which the actor says was turned into his living space as he had no money to rent a house in the early stages of his career in the film industry. Ronit Roy, who had a breakthrough with the popular TV show Kasautii Zindagii Kay as Rishabh Bajaj, said he would live in his car with all his clothes packed in a huge suitcase. Asking to stay at a friendâ€™s place was never an option as Ronit said it was â€œshamefulâ€ and he had a lot of self-respect.
This weirdly happened after Ronit had a successful debut with Jaan Tere Naam, but the stardom went away after a series of missteps, like excessive drinking.
â€œNobody helped me, asked me, â€˜Is there food in your house? Do you even have a house?â€™ I didnâ€™t even have a house for the longest time, I was living in a car! I had one big suitcase, it used to be in the boot of my car and all my clothes were in it. Because I had to leave the place where I was earlier living as I didnâ€™t have money to pay rent. I could not go back to someoneâ€™s house and say please let me stay. It is shameful. On and off would use the hotels in Juhu, all the public lavatories to freshen up and go to shoots,â€ he said in an interview with Lehren Retro.

The 58-year-old actor said back then sets didnâ€™t have vanity vans and the locations he was shooting in were places like a school. â€œThere I would ask for a bucket to bathe, make my hair. It was tough.
â€œThatâ€™s why I have a very good laugh when the media time would ask, â€˜This transition from film to TV, it must have been very difficult to come down to TV?â€™ I was completely unemployed, I had nothing! TV was actually a blessing and a boon to me,â€ he added.
Post Kasautii Zindagii Kay, Ronit Roy went on to star in Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi as Mihir Virani and later had a successful comeback to the big screen with Vikramaditya Motwaneâ€™s 2010 drama Udaan.

While many remember him for his television roles, Ronit initiated his career in films with the 1992 blockbuster Jaan Tere Naam. Despite a promising start in the entertainment industry, Ronit Roy faced a downfall due to his casual approach towards success, leading him to indulge in alcohol. This phase lasted for nine years until he found his breakthrough in television, eventually marking his big comeback.
In a recent interview with Lehren Retro, Ronit opened up about his struggle with alcohol, recalling instances where he would arrive on set after a night of drinking. He said, â€œI didnâ€™t understand success. I became a hero and I never thought it would end. When you are drinking you make a host of other mistakes. One mistake I never made is that I have never been late for a shoot but, despite reaching on time, I didnâ€™t have my faculties around me because I would be drinking four hours before the shoot. I didnâ€™t sleep and my eyes would be bulging. You are not supposed to look like that. There is a responsibility on you. People come to theatres to watch you and you have to give back to them.â€

In an interview with Mainstreet TV, Tanya was asked about the most â€˜annoyingâ€™ actor to work with. She replied and said, â€œI love Sara. Me and Saraâ€¦ had a fight after Simmba, because I was like, â€˜Can you just listen to me?â€™  And then she started wearing some random clothes, you know. And then I was like â€˜No, you canâ€™t do this.â€™ We had a fight. We didnâ€™t talk for one and a half years. Over a year and a bad fight, an actual fight. Actually, we kind of spoke, but we didnâ€™t work together for a year and a half.â€

"â€œCan I die and be reborn as a girl,â€ little Lucia (SofÃ­a Otero) asks her great-aunt Lourdes (Ane Gabarain) in a heartwrenchingly innocent manner, encapsulating the emotional turmoil she grapples with regularly. Spanish filmmaker Estibaliz Urresola Solagurenâ€™s debut feature 20.000 especies de abejas (20,000 Species of Bees), centres around Lucia, her quest to discover her true self and her family membersâ€™ efforts to come to terms with the changes and the attempts of a few to be there for her in the ways possible to them.
A heartwarming film that sheds light on the struggles trans kids go through as they begin to understand their identity, and how near and dear ones can leave a positive impact on their lives, easing their journey in a world where they face constant questioning, bullying, scrutiny and harassment, 20,000 Species of Bees emphasises that loved ones need to do only two fundamental things to help them â€” LISTEN and accept them for who they are or aspire to be.
In an interview with The Guardian earlier this year, Solaguren mentioned that the core idea of the film developed after she learned about the suicide of a 16-year-old trans boy in the Basque Country, Spain, where she lives. She recalled that he took the drastic step to â€œshine some light on people in his situation, for visibility.â€ While itâ€™s distressing to even contemplate the need for someone to resort to such extremes for visibility, this is not an isolated incident; there have been numerous cases where victims, subjected to social injustice and cyber attacks, have taken similar measures.

India too is no haven. 16-year-old queer kid and self-taught makeup artist Pranshu and Keralaâ€™s first transgender bodybuilder Praveen Nath were indeed victims of everything wrong with a heteronormative and transphobic society that still persists even today.
Hence, the 2023 Spanish drama gains relevance as it effectively portrays compassion as a simple yet potent tool capable of helping trans kids, or any kid grappling with crises incomprehensible for others, accept themselves without shame.
Screened at the 28th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK), 20,000 Species of Bees is mostly set in the Basque Country during a sweltering summer when Lucia, accompanied by her mother Ane (Patricia LÃ³pez Arnaiz) and two siblings, visits her maternal family. Amidst a backdrop of buzzing bees, Lucia comes to realise her identity as a girl and desires to be treated accordingly. She rejects her birth name, Aitor, and is not happy with the nickname CocÃ³ either. Though initially unable to express what she is going through, Lucia slowly begins communicating with her great-aunt Lourdes (Ane Gabarain) as she is the only one who listens to her without any judgments.
ADVERTISEMENT
Struggling with discomfort in her evolving body, Lucia, initially averse to hugs and kisses, eventually expresses affection through physical touch to Lourdes when she asserts that she doesnâ€™t have to die and be reborn to live as a girl. However, despite Aneâ€™s persistent efforts to support Lucia, Aneâ€™s own identity crisis, entangled with professional and personal challenges, hinders her ability to truly hear Lucia. This emotional gap leads Lucia to distance herself from her mother a bit, emphasising that what she craves is not advice or correction but simply a pair of ears and a heart that genuinely LISTENS.
Where the film shines the most is in its ability to communicate many things through seemingly small and subtle moments, conversations and emotional expressions. For example, at a significant juncture in the film, Lucia goes missing, leading the worried family to search for her in a forest. While the rest of her family loudly calls out the name Aitor, Ane realises that Lucia wonâ€™t respond to that name. Despite informing her husband Gorka (Martxelo Rubio), he struggles to accept that his son identifies as a girl, intensifying Aneâ€™s distress. Amid the chaos, Luciaâ€™s brother Eneko (Unax Hayden) boldly calls out for her using the name â€œLuciaâ€, without hesitation, sparking a shift in everyoneâ€™s perspectives. Itâ€™s only then that even Ane starts addressing her as Lucia, emphasising the importance of initiating change from a young age.

While Solaguren adeptly captures the essence of the serene yet unhappening setting, avoiding any loud or preachy elements that might compromise the filmâ€™s simple yet significant core, it is little SofÃ­a Otero to whom the film ultimately belongs. Portraying the character Lucia with utmost brilliance to the extent that one can hardly believe itâ€™s her debut film, Otero effectively brings out the struggles of a transgender child with maximum precision. She won the Silver Bear for Best Leading Performance at the 73rd Berlin International Film Festival this year, becoming the youngest person to bag the award.
In another poignant scene, as family members are outside their room quarrelling about Lucia, an extremely heart-wrenched child can be seen lying on the bed, sobbing, while Eneko lies next to her trying to comfort her in ways possible for his young self. This moment emphasises how challenging it is for children to endure such disputes among family members, especially when the matters concern them directly. Oteroâ€™s performance here is sure to impact viewers profoundly as she melts into the bed, her face red from crying.

While Patricia LÃ³pez Arnaiz and Ane Gabarain deliver outstanding performances, Gina Ferrerâ€™s cinematography is certain to captivate viewers. Meanwhile, Izaskun Urkijoâ€™s art direction enhances the movieâ€™s mood and tone, transforming it into an impressive cinematic experience.
By clearly reminding viewers that there are about 20,000 species of bees around us, each with its own uniqueness and strengths, Estibaliz Urresola Solaguren delivers a powerful message through this drama that trans lives matter."
"Veteran actor Parikshit Sahni, who has been a part of films like PK and 3 Idiots, recently opened up about working with Aamir Khan. Sahni remembered a scene where he had to slap Aamir, and like any actor, he initially fake-slapped him. However, Aamir insisted that on a real slap. Unsatisfied with the first attempt, he asked Sahni to genuinely slap him again. The veteran actor had to slap Aamir in Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s film PK. The film also starred Anushka Sharma and late actor Sushant Singh Rajput.
In an interview with Rajshri Unplugged, Sahni said, â€œI had to slap Aamir in one of the scenes of that film. Aamir is a fantastic actor, I really like him.â€ The actor continued, â€œWhen I fake slapped him, he told me, â€˜You slap me.â€™ I said, â€˜How can I hit you?â€™ He said, â€˜No, no you must.â€™ The credit goes to him. The first time I hit him, he stopped and said, â€˜You really hit me.â€™ Very few actors do this. He is a great actor. He is a very very great actor. That is because he knows the script very well.â€

"Triptii Dimri, who played a small but pivotal role in Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s much-discussed film Animal, has received a lot of appreciation for her role as Zoya in the film. In a recent interview, Triptii discussed how she shot her intimate scenes in the film with Ranbir, and her parentsâ€™ reaction to them when they saw it on screen. She shared that it took them some time to get over it.
Speaking to Bollywood Hungama, Triptii said, â€œMy parents got a little taken aback. (They said) We have never seen something like this in films and you have done it. It took them time to get over that scene. They were very sweet to me though. They were like, â€˜You shouldnâ€™t have done that but itâ€™s okay. As parents, we will obviously feel this.â€™ And I told them I am not doing anything wrong. Itâ€™s my job and as long as I am comfortable and safe, I donâ€™t see any problem in that. I am an actor and I have to be 100 percent honest with the character that I play and I did that.â€

Animal has also crossed the collections of all-time grosser Dangal which earned Rs 387.38 crore in the domestic market back when it released in 2016.

In the southern states, Animal is expected to face competition as Prabhasâ€™ Salaar, which is also scheduled for release on the same date.
Rashmika recently took to social media to defend Animal and share insights about her character Gitanjali in the film. She wrote, â€œShe is pure, real, unfiltered, strong and raw.. At times as an actor, I would question some of Gitanjaliâ€™s actions.. And I remember my director telling me â€“ this was their story.. Ranvijayâ€™s & Gitanjaliâ€™s.. it was their love and passion, their families and their lives â€“ this is who they are.â€ Animal has been facing a lot of criticism from critics and the audience for glorifying toxic masculinity and for being excessively violent and gory.

"Filmmaker Nelson Dilipkumarâ€™s Jailer, starring superstar Rajinikanth, emerged as a global hit upon its release in August this year. But before commencing work on the film and even during production, Nelson had significant doubts about how he would project Rajinikanth on the big screen. His creative choices were questioned by members of his own crew, and he was advised to let Rajinikanth do what he does best and not experiment.
In a new interview, Nelson shared how he stuck to his guns and didnâ€™t allow anyone to muddle his vision. He shared with Film Companion that he always wanted to make a film with Rajinikanth. Once the script was completed, Nelson had doubts even during the shoot. He shared, â€œThis is the first time I made him play his age, that was the major doubt in me because people told me, â€˜Donâ€™t make him play his age. Let him do whatever he has done already. Donâ€™t grey his hair.â€™ But I was like, even if it has to fail, let it be with my gut, I will take the blame. I didnâ€™t want someone to confuse me.â€

The filmmaker revealed that the pre-interval action sequence of the movie took him a month to write. In the sequence, Rajinikanth is seen sitting at a dining table with his wife and daughter-in-law and a dead body falls on them. â€œI thought about staging that scene for a month. I wanted Rajini sir to be cool in that whole film. Rather than him fighting, whatever happens around him should be more interesting and never seen before in his films. I myself wrote the whole stunt and scripted the whole scene,â€ shared Nelson.
ADVERTISEMENT
However, on the day of the shoot, the fight choreographer asked Nelson, â€œIs it okay that Rajini sir is not doing anything?â€ Not just him, â€œMany people asked if Rajini sir (should be given something to do) at least. These decisions were a little difficult for me, but I liked the staging of that situation.â€ Nelson went with his gut and ended up delivering a massive hit.

"Almost three years after the tremendous success of Drishyam 2, Malayalam superstar Mohanlal and ace filmmaker Jeethu Joseph have joined forces yet again, this time for the courtroom drama Neru. Two weeks ahead of the filmâ€™s release, the makers have unveiled its official trailer, promising that Neru will provide a hard-hitting experience.
The 146-second trailer begins by showing a group of cops working at the Thumba police station in Thiruvananthapuram, probing a case.

"Alia Bhatt and Karan Joharâ€™s deep personal bond is not something moviegoers are unaware of.

"Veteran actor Prem Chopra became the go-to guy for villainous characters in the 1970s. So, when the legendary Raj Kapoor approached him to make a special appearance in Rishi Kapoorâ€™s launch vehicle, Bobby, Chopra was hesitant. He was worried about doing a special appearance in a film at the peak of his career, and thought other producers would also start offering him only special appearances in their films. But Raj Kapoor was adamant that Chopra should play the part in his film.
During a recent appearance on the Timeout With Ankit podcast, Chopra revealed that he was initially excited when Kapoor offered him a role in Bobby, â€œWho wouldnâ€™t want to work with Raj Kapoor?â€ he said. But, the twist in the tale came when Kapoor told Chopra that his role would be short. The actor expressed his hesitance to Kapoor. â€œAt that time, I was doing equal roles with Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, Jeetendra and Dharmendra. I told him, â€˜Raj ji, if I will do a special appearance in your film, then the other producers who have been giving me work regularly might say, â€˜You have done a special appearance in Raj Kapoorâ€™s film, now do the same for usâ€™,â€ the actor shared. But Kapoor didnâ€™t take no for an answer, and told him, â€œTujhe karna hai toh karna hi hai (I donâ€™t care, you will have to do it).â€

"Director Jeo Babyâ€™s Kaathal â€“ The Core, featuring Mammootty and Jyothika in the lead roles, received widespread acclaim from both critics and audiences for its sensitive handling of bold and revolutionary themes. However, one area where the film fell short was in its exploration of the relationship between Mathew (Mammootty) and his lover Thankan (Sudhi Kozhikode). Even in our review of the movie, we noted that â€œa more in-depth exploration of the relationship between Mathew and his partner was undoubtedly needed.â€

Discussing the deliberate decision to avoid portraying any personal moments or on-screen interactions between Mathew and Thankan, director Jeo Baby explained during the Film Companion directorsâ€™ adda, â€œThe screenplay was precisely designed this way. In it, they never meet but watch each other from a distance. The script was crafted by Adarsh Sukumaran and Paulson Skaria. Mammootty was the first choice that came to my mind. I needed Mammootty as both the actor and the human being for this film. After narrating the story to him, he not only suggested some changes but also became deeply involved in its further development. He actively participated in numerous discussions, even sending WhatsApp messages to me occasionally with suggestions. His support was truly invaluable. For instance, during the interval portion, Mammootty proposed allowing them to share a moment of eye contact. Although we had already written something, we made that change based on his suggestion, and it worked in our favour.

"While Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s Animal has found success at the box office, it has faced criticism for its portrayal of toxic masculinity and misogyny. Addressing the controversy, actor Saloni Batra, who played Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s onscreen sister, has shared her perspective on the portrayal of women in the film, stating that movies are often inspired by flawed characters.
In an interview with Bollywood Hungama, Batra said, â€œIâ€™m an artist; Iâ€™m here to be a part of storytelling. As you can see, people are loving the film; theyâ€™re appreciating everythingâ€”how sir has put everything together, what people are feeling when theyâ€™re sitting in the theatre and watching the film with the background score, with the dialogues, with whatever is happening.â€

"Actor Shah Rukh Khan has always been a peopleâ€™s person who makes sure to individually interact with crew members on his projects. Recalling an anecdote, ad guru Prahlad Kakkar said that the Pathaan actor stepped up to save the crew from his wrath during an ad shoot. On Cyrus Broachaâ€™s podcast, Prahlad spilled the beans on his experience of working with Shah Rukh Khan. He recalled, â€œShah Rukh was brilliant. Heâ€™s easygoing and very compassionate with the crew. So, if anyone would be shouting at crew, he would cover up for them.â€
Prahlad shared one of his fondest memories of working with Shah Rukh, from when they were doing a noodle commercial together. â€œI remember once, we were doing a noodle shoot for Nissin. I had especially selected the bowls to match the noodles. Yellow on the inside and red on the outside. And the crew misplaced my bowls, and here I am waiting for the shot and there are no bowls. They brought some other bowls, which I rejected and threw a fit, and everyone was hiding.â€

"Veteran actor Prem Chopra, known for his roles in nearly 400 films over five decades, was recently seen in the blockbuster film Animal. The actor rose to fame for playing antagonists in Rajesh Khannaâ€™s movies such as Doli, Upkaar, and Do Raaste. In a new interview, he recalled anecdotes about his wedding.

"Zoya Akhtarâ€™s teen musical comedy The Archies was released on Netflix, marking her first direct-to-OTT film. Penned by Ayesha Devitre Dhillon, Reema Kagti and Zoya herself, the film marked the debut of three star-kids â€” Agastya Nanda, Suhana Khan and Khushi Kapoor â€” alongside four other newcomers: Vedang Raina, Mihir Ahuja, Aditi â€œDot.â€ Saigal and Yuvraj Menda.
Opening up about the nepotism debate, Zoya said during a chat with The Juggernaut, â€œI think it (the debate) is about privilege, access, and social capital. I completely understand having anger or frustration at the fact that you do not have the access some people get so easily. That is a conversation to be had. Everyone needs to have the same kind of education, job opportunities, et al.â€

"Actor Bobby Deol is humbled by the praise coming his way for his performance in director Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Animal. Crediting his successful return to prominence to wife Tanya, the actor called himself â€˜broad-mindedâ€™ for never forcing her to stop working. In an interview, he also said that he didnâ€™t want to repeat the same mistakes as his father.
In an interview with Zoom Entertainment, Bobby shared how his relationship with sons Aryaman and Dharam is different from the one he had with his father, Dharmendra, during the formative years. â€œWhen I was growing up, it was a different scenario all together,â€ said Bobby, adding, â€œThere was respect that you had to keep for your parents. You cannot go beyond certain things. With your mothers, you can still fight, still argue. Mothers are made like that, but fathers ke saath always jhijhak (hesitation) rehti thi.â€

"Veteran actor Prem Chopra, who was recently seen in Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s Animal, has opened up about his long and successful partnership with the late superstar Rajesh Khanna. In an interview, he shared that while Khanna was the Hindi film industryâ€™s first superstar, he could not make the necessary adjustments when he stardom started to fade. Prem Chopra and Rajesh Khanna have done over 20 films together, including Haathi Mere Saathi, Do Raaste, Kati Patang, Ajanabee, Souten, Krati and Purab aur Paschim.
In an appearance on the Timeout With Ankit Podcast, Prem Chopra shared how Rajesh Khanna had a habit of being late to work. He said, â€œWe did 25 films together out of which 20 were superhits. It was a good experience (working with him). We became good friends, he was a misunderstood man. He was a great actor, the first superstar. But he had a habit of coming late on the set, and many directors and producers would have a problem with that. But this is a business, when you have a superstar, the film is driven by his name and negotiations happen. Theyâ€™d crib about him not reaching on time but once heâ€™d reach, they would greet him warmly and ask him â€˜ab lunch karenge ya shooting karenge (would you like to have lunch first or start shooting now)?â€™, and heâ€™d say, â€˜No, letâ€™s shoot.â€™ His specialty was that he completed his work every day before leaving, and he would do it brilliantly.â€

"Actor Bobby Deol is currently enjoying the success of his recent movie Animal, directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga. Despite having only 15 minutes of screen time in the lengthy 3.5-hour film, Bobby, who played the brutal villain Abrar, has won over the audience. In an interview, he said that he doesnâ€™t judge his characters, and said that he played Abrar as if he was the hero of his own story, ready to do anything for his family. Bobby also shared that both he and Ranbir Kapoor were unsure about whom to sympathise with in the film.
In an interview with Zoom Entertainment, Bobby said, â€œI didnâ€™t look at myself as a villain in the film because Abrar loses his grandfather in front of his eyes, who burns himself, and that shock takes away his voice. So, he swears that heâ€™ll avenge his grandfatherâ€™s death, and heâ€™s a very family-oriented man. Heâ€™s romantic; he has three wives and would kill for his family. So, that was the thought that was there in my mind while playing it. Thatâ€™s why when you see the character, you feel for the character, even though heâ€™s supposed to be the antagonist. And I think when we were shooting the fight sequence, even Ranbir said that to me, â€˜We donâ€™t know who to sympathise with.'â€

"Since it marked his first feature directorial venture after four years, Vetrimaaranâ€™s Viduthalai Part 1 generated significant hype well before its release. Adding to the excitement was the fact that Soori, primarily known for comedic roles, was chosen as the lead of this period crime thriller, with Vijay Sethupathi also portraying a key character.
However, the filmâ€™s production faced unexpected challenges, and director Vetrimaaran recently shared insights into his chaotic process at the Film Companion directorâ€™s roundtable, leaving many of his contemporaries such as Karan Johar and Nelson Dilipkumar flabbergasted. Recalling his initial commitment to complete the project in 35 days, akin to his previous work Visaranai (2016), Vetrimaaran said that upon visiting the locations, he realised he could only accomplish 10 per cent of the film in 20 days. He reflected, â€œBy then, we had already exhausted 70 per cent of the budget. The hill we chose for filming prohibited vehicle access, necessitating the manual transport of all equipment. Atop the hill, we set up tents for 250 people and installed 10-12 toilets for the villagers, so that we could also use them. One day, a severe storm arrived and dismantled all our tents. Upon returning to the ground, I came to the realisation that I canâ€™t complete this project.â€

"Filmmaker Karan Johar has opened up about his creative process, and personal evolution as a director. Karan admitted to making mistakes in his earlier movies, and explained how his views on intense romance have changed over time. What he once thought was passion, he later learned was no different from stalking. The filmmaker also revealed the advice given by fellow filmmaker Zoya Akhtar. 
In an interview with Film Companion, Karan said, â€œI never viewed Rocky Aur Rani as a love story; I saw it as my homage to Hindi cinema. What I aimed to do was bring in a commentary on things I strongly believe in. I grew up dancing to Indian music on my own and being mocked by my friends. Moreover, I grew up understanding that people can have love stories that are brushed under the carpet because Iâ€™ve known it in my own family.â€

"Filmmaker Karan Johar recently opened up about basing his 2016 film, Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, on his own unrequited love story. He also recalled the moment Ranbir Kapoor realised that he was playing Karan in the film, and what happened next. A the the Film Companionâ€™s directorsâ€™ round-table, Karan shared that Ae Dil Hai Mushkil was inspired by his own heartbreak. He shared, â€œAe Dil Hai Mushkil arrived as a love story which was my story. That was my story because I, in those six years, fell in love with somebody that was not mine and I understood what one-sided love is.â€
He continued, â€œThen I realised that there is a creature called unrequited love that is heartbreaking it can shatter you to pieces to smithereens actually, and thereâ€™s a physical pain. When we say heartache, it is not symbolic, it is true, it hurts and it hurts like hell. You feel like literally the earth has slipped by you, and you donâ€™t know what to do. Making that film, that was the most cathartic journey Iâ€™ve had with the film.â€

"Filmmaker Karan Johar took a trip down memory lane and recalled when his late father. Yash Johar, kept praising him in front of the revered filmmaker Mani Ratnam. Karan, whose debut film Kuch Kuch Hota Hai was yet to release, revealed how his father couldnâ€™t contain his excitement about him and recounted an awkward encounter with Mani Ratnam.
On the Film Companion Directors Adda 2023, Karan said, â€œHe (Yash Johar) thought I was the most gorgeous person on planet Earth, the best director. I used to get scared going anywhere with him because he would start showing off about me. I used to die because he met Mani sir at the same location where Kuch Kuch Hota Hai was being shot. Mani sir was making Dil Se, and he was shooting the â€˜Chaiya Chaiyaâ€™ song, which, as a student, I wanted to go and watch.â€

"Vicky Kaushal is receiving all the love for his earnest portrayal of Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw in Sam Bahadur. The film, however, had a slow start at the box office amid the Animal onslaught. According to industry tracing website Sacnilk, director Meghna Gulzarâ€˜s biopic earned Rs 3.25 crore on day eight, taking its total domestic collections to Rs 42.05 crore. The filmâ€™s worldwide gross earnings now stand at Rs 53.8 crore.
The Vicky Kaushal-starrer witnessed an overall 28.17 percent  Hindi occupancy on Friday, with Pune ranking number one with 48.25 percent occupancy, followed by Mumbai with 30.50 percent occupancy and Delhi NCR with 28 percent.

Director Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s crime epic has already earned Rs 563.03 crore worldwide.

"Shatrughan Sinha was one of the biggest stars in Hindi movies in the 1970s and though pan-Indian movies were not really a thing back in the day, many people across India watched movies from different regions and followed their favourite stars. Chiranjeevi, who started his career in Telugu movies in 1978, once shared that he gained the confidence of becoming an actor only because he was saw Shatrughan on screen. Even Rajinikanth, who is one of the most popular Indian movie stars of all time, said that he drew inspiration from Shatrughan during the early part of his career.
Both Chiranjeevi and Rajinikanth spoke about this in Shatrughan Sinhaâ€™s biography, Anything But Khamosh, and shared how Shatrughanâ€™s influence was evident at the start of their careers. â€œI became an actor because of Shatrughan Sinha,â€ shared Chiranjeevi and added that back in those days, he went to watch a Hindi film only for Shatrughan as â€œhe was the main attraction for me.â€

"Frustrated with spineless media, corporate takeover and journalists on payroll, angered citizens hit the streets to oppose a resolution passed by the local council that can destroy carefully nurtured shared history. It could be the India of today, but itâ€™s also the past of a fictional town of Zoya Akhtarâ€™s latest musical The Archiesâ€” the new Netflix feature that offers Christmas candies wrapped in a pamphlet of young rebellion.
Also Read | The Archies movie review: Suhana Khan grows on you, Khushi Kapoor packs verve
The publicity campaign of The Archies was fueled with intenseâ€”at least back when it was announcedâ€”criticism of casting three privileged star kids out of the seven young debutants. It marks the acting debut of Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s daughter Suhana, megastar Amitabh Bachchanâ€™s grandson Agastya and actor Sridevi and film producer Boney Kapoorâ€™s daughter Khushi. The narrative aligned with the years of unfair labeling of Akhtar as a maker interested only in chronicling stories of the rich. Having star kids in the ensemble only added a dash of a smug of course.

"On whether itâ€™s possible to be a star and remain authentic
Gulzar: Whether itâ€™s possible or not I donâ€™t know, but it should be prescribed because I think the audience sniffs artificiality and that comes in the way. My mother was a star in her own right at a time when there was no social media. So that was just pure and raw stardom. I think stardom is also different things to different people. For him (Vicky), I think, it is getting the adulation and the approval of his audience for his work more than the trappings that stardom is known for. This is a very personal interpretation of what stardom is or should be, but I donâ€™t see his lacking or wanting in any way.
On his breakout role in Masaan
Kaushal: At that time, I was just a boy looking for opportunities, a very hungry and stubborn boy. I auditioned for Masaan (2015) and got selected. Apart from Richa Chadha and Sanjay Mishraji, it was everybodyâ€™s first film. So it was made with a lot of purity. It was a lot of novices coming together with a lot of passion for that breakout opportunity. I went to Banaras about three weeks before we started shooting and tried to just be one with the place. Apart from learning the language, the culture, about the Dom community (that cremates bodies), I had an audio track which was just â€˜Ram Naam Satya Haiâ€™. I used to put that on my headphones and would try to sleep to that music. At first, it used to be very haunting but I tried it because for the boy Deepak (the character he plays, who belongs to the Dom community) it must have been his lullaby. He has lived there only. I spent a lot of time at the cremation ground. I remember the first time I went there, I couldnâ€™t sit there for 15 minutes but eventually I was able to spend days over there, was able to have a cup of tea right next to a burning pyre and say â€˜shakkar kam haiâ€™ (the sugar is less). So it was just surrendering to that whole world.

Somebody I was sharing my makeup room with had got ideas in his head that I could be a good life partner to Divyanka and vice versa. He kind of stitched us and we met a couple of times. Then things went ahead. We realised we are supposed to be together.â€

"Whatâ€™s striking about Kastoori is the underlying dreaminess. Even though the movie takes an unpretentious and unflinching look at an underprivileged school-going boyâ€™s struggle to continue his education, the movie rarely shows him giving up hope. This dreaminess is at times expressed through the soothing background score but mostly through the undying optimism and smiles of Gopi (Samarth Sonawane).
Gopi is engaged in manual scavenging, cleaning toilets, and assisting in performing autopsies while his father spends most of his time at a local bar. In spite of being a bright student, Gopi is forced to choose between education and work since he has to contribute to his familyâ€™s income. With the help of soap and attar, Gopi tries to get rid of the smell that he fears he carries after all the scavenging and cleaning work. Gopi, prodded by his best friend (Shravan Upalakar), dreams of kastoori (musk) that will take away the odoriferous proof of his harsh life as well as class.

"Bollywood actor Manoj Bajpayee took a trip down the memory lane and recalled how his wife Shabana Raza reacted after watching his best and worst films. Manoj also revealed that they often argue because he doesnâ€™t share the script with her. He prefers to keep the element of surprise intact, wanting to see her genuine reaction after watching his films.
In an interview with The Lallantop, Manoj said, â€œShabana has the complaint that I donâ€™t share scripts with her. Because I like giving surprises to Shabana. I wait for the reaction and emotions that follow after surprising her. The biggest compliments and criticism I get are by Shabana. So whatever she feels after seeing the film should be first. So only I donâ€™t share scripts and she complains a lot about it. There have been fights about the same.â€

"Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s latest film Animal is drawing all kinds of attention â€” good, bad and ugly from the audience. But those who have watched the film are unified in praising actor Ranbir Kapoor, who is seen in a never-seen-before avatar of a ruthless businessman. To get into the skin of his character, Ranbir underwent a physical transformation as well. However, now a video that is going viral on social media, reveals that while the actor sweats it out in the gym to get the chiselled chest and six-pack abs, he used prosthetics to showcase his characterâ€™s ageing and his pot-bellied look.
In the video, Ranbir is seen putting on the prosthetic pot-belly to make his stomach look fuller. He wears a silicon bodysuit to achieve the desired look. As the video surfaced on social media, some of the actorâ€™s fans praised him for his performance and his hard work for the film, and some questioned him for not putting on weight naturally instead of using prosthetics.

"Forget Gene Wilder, forget Johnny Depp, in fact forget Willy Wonka too for a moment. Think Charlie. For, this is what the latest iteration of the Roald Dahl classic essentially is. Chalamet is so sweet and uncomplicated â€“ more a lump of sugar than a bean of cocoa â€“ that his Willy could pass off for the innocent Charlie (without the need for a lifetime of chocolate supply, as he can whip them up on demand).
There are no daddy issues, only fond mama memories â€“ and few mamas evoke as much fondness as Sally Hawkins (she appears briefly). There are two Dickensian characters exploiting an orphan (among other people), three big chocolate businessmen running a cartel, one corruptible police chief, and one pliable priest. However, nothing terribly bad happens in this Warner Brothers film â€“ unless you count being almost drowned in gallons of melted chocolate.

"Actor Nithiin, who is struggling with four back-to-back flops, and writer-director Vakkantham Vamshi, who helmed the critically acclaimed Naa Peru Surya and wrote the super flop Agent earlier this year, are uniting for Extra Ordinary Man. This is Vamshiâ€™s second directorial. The makers have openly declared that the film is going to be a routine commercial fare, albeit with a fresh approach. Casting actor Rajasekhar in an important role is definitely refreshing. Letâ€™s move on to what else worked in the movie, or not.
Abhinav (Nithiin) is a background actor who is always looking for that big break. After lots of waiting and taunts from his father to find better employment, he finally decides to leave cinema to work for Likhitha (Sreeleela), hoping to win her love also in the process.

"â€œShe was youngerâ€¦but something about the young girlâ€™s eyes told me not to reject her.â€
Satyajit Ray couldnâ€™t resist Sharmila Tagoreâ€™s eyes when she was just 13 â€” they asked a lot of questions, and often daydreamed back in 1959. To some, they are reminiscent of â€˜Ye chaand sa roshan chehra, zulfon ka rang sunehra, ye jheel se neeli aankhein, koi raaz hai inme gehraâ€™. To others, they still exude the elegance and innocence of Apuâ€™s child bride Aparna (Satyajit Rayâ€™s Apur Sansar). But what remains common is adulation among cinephiles for this beauty-with-brains who defied the Hindi film industryâ€™s and societyâ€™s unwritten rules by choice, not necessity.

"Actor Mansi Taxak, who played one of the three wives of the character Abrar in the film Animal, contradicted herself as she spoke about the scene in which her character is subjected to marital rape by her husband, played by Bobby Deol. In an interview, Mansi denied that any sort of assault happened in the scene, but admitted that the â€˜twistedâ€™ Abrar was â€˜filled with animal instinctsâ€™ in that scene, which prompted him to vent his frustrations on his wives.
Directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga and starring Ranbir Kapoor, Animal has come under fire for its depiction of toxic masculinity and misogyny. Despite this, the film has emerged as a major hit, having grossed around Rs 550 crore at the worldwide box office. Vanga basically went through a similar cycle with his previous film, Kabir Singh.

"How bad can a Pankaj Tripathi film be? This question came up as soon as I began watching Kadak Singh, which features a crack investigator suffering from memory loss. It grates even as it begins, and refuses to get better.
Retrograde amnesia is a great pal of Indian script-writers, and in this Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury directorial, it is whatâ€™s plaguing top financial crimes sleuth A K Srivastava (Pankaj Tripathi) who is critically unwell. As he regains consciousness in his hospital bed, he realises he remembers very little, and despite the best efforts of his daughter (Sanjana Sanghi), comely confidante (Jaya Ahsan) and close colleague (Paresh Pahuja), nothing rings a bell.

"Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s film Animal, starring Ranbir Kapoor, is in the theatres and it has turned out to be the most divisive film of the year. The film is being seen as misogynistic and triggering by a section of the audience and actor Siddhant Karnick, who played the role of Ranbirâ€™s brother-in-law in the film, recently opened up about performing one such scene in the film. Sidhhant plays Varun, the husband of Ranbirâ€™s sister Reet, played by Saloni Batra. In one of the scenes, his character flings a burning cigarette towards his wife and Siddhant shared that it is important to separate reel from the real so the effect of such characters doesnâ€™t impact his own life.
Talking to Filme Shilmy about this scene, Siddhant said, â€œThis is where the training comes in. You switch on, you switch off. You donâ€™t bring that psyche back home. You donâ€™t bring that into your personal life with your friends and family. Thatâ€™s when actors go psychotic.â€ Siddhant added that it is â€œtemptingâ€ to â€œgo darkâ€ and shared, â€œAs professionals, it can get very tempting to go dark. As someone who comes from the outside, where do I not have that many opportunities, any opportunity I get, I want to make the most of it.â€

"Patriotism is in the air and itâ€™s flying at jet speed. The makers of Fighter on Friday dropped the teaser of their highly anticipated aerial actioner, which is headlined by Hrithik Roshan, Deepika Padukone and Anil Kapoor.
The more than a minute-long teaser takes the viewers to dizzying heightsâ€”quite cinematicallyâ€”as it introduces the world of the film. There are jets flying, slow-mo entry shots, aviator glasses, thumping Vishal-Shekhar music, aerial stunts, perhaps a tragedy and definitely a victory. And of course, Hrithik in a whistle-worthy money shot with the Indian flag.

"Telugu star Nani and Mrunal Thakurâ€˜s romantic drama, Hi Nanna, has received largely positive reviews and is bringing audiences to theatres. The film, directed by Shouryuv, has performed well on its opening day and according to industry tracker Sacnilk, the film eared Rs 6.10 crore on Thursday, the day of its release.
Hi Nanna was initially scheduled for a worldwide theatrical release on December 21, however, the makers brought forward its release date to December 7 to avoid clashing with Prabhasâ€™ epic action thriller film Salaar, directed by KGF fame Prastanth Neel. The decision seems to have proved to be a wise move as no other major Telugu films have released this week and the film will enjoy a free run at the box office, extending into next week also.

"â€˜Rocking Starâ€™ Yash has finally announced his follow-up to KGF: Chapter 2. The Kannada star will headline director Geetu Mohandasâ€˜ Toxic, described in a recently released video as â€˜a fairy-tale for grown-upsâ€™. The short video doesnâ€™t reveal any footage from the movie, nor does it give an idea of what the filmâ€™s plot will be, but through a series of animated visuals, it gives a sense of the tone.
We see shots of Joker cards, explosions, and a quick glimpse of a man wearing a hat, smoking a cigar, and brandishing what looks like a Tommy gun. Is Toxic a period gangster movie? Or is it an anti-hero crime thriller in the vein of Todd Phillipsâ€™ Joker movie. It looks like the movie will continue the blockbuster trend of major movie stars playing violent men, following in the footsteps of Kamal Haasanâ€™s Vikram, Vijayâ€™s Leo, and most recently, Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s Animal.

"Director Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s Animal has been divisive film; on the one hand, it is making a killing at the box office, but on the other, itâ€™s drawing criticism for its glorification of toxic masculinity. Now, the controversy has reached the floor of the Rajya Sabha, with Congress MP Ranjeet Ranjan telling Parliament that her daughter broke down in tears after watching the crime epic.
She said according to AajTak, â€œCinema is a mirror of society. We have grown up watching cinema, and it can influence the youth. First, there were films like Kabir Singh and Pushpa, and now there is Animal. My daughter went to watch the film with her college friends, and walked out midway through because she couldnâ€™t stop crying.â€

"Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap declared that Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor, both of whom he has worked with in the past, are the countryâ€™s best actors. In an interview, Anurag looked back on his collaboration with Ranbir on the critical and commercial disappointment Bombay Velvet, and explained why it wouldnâ€™t be a good idea to work with a major star again.
Ranbirâ€™s career has attained new heights since Bombay Velvet, thanks to blockbusters such as Sanju, and more recently, Animal. Directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, Animal has made nearly Rs 550 crore worldwide in about a week of release, and is expected to set new box office records for Hindi cinema. Anurag told Pinkvilla that his commercial sensibilities arenâ€™t that strong. â€œRanbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt are the finest actors. And theyâ€™re a couple. Imagine the amount of talent in one house. If (Animal) is successful for him, itâ€™s good for him,â€ he said.

"Veteran actor Naeem Sayyed, who was popularly known as Junior Mehmood, passed away in Mumbai on Friday at the age of 67. The actor gained fame when he started working as a child artist and became popular as Junior Mehmood after the senior actor took him under his wing. Mehmood was one of the most popular comedians of that time and he accepted Naeem as his disciple after they worked together in the 1968 film Suhaag Raat.
Junior Mehmood  spoke about his relationship with the veteran actor, whom he addressed as â€˜Bhaijaanâ€™ in an earlier interview with Amar Ujala and said that he first visited Mehmoodâ€™s house as a guest on his daughterâ€™s first birthday. â€œI got a chance to work with Mehmood in the film Suhaag Raat as his brother-in-law. We became quite friendly during the shoot of that film. It was his daughterâ€™s first birthday when he invited the entire unit to his house and I also went,â€ he shared.

"Designed as a contemporary Mumbai fable, Mast Mein Rehne Ka makes you believe the cup is half-full even when things go horribly awry. With such optimism as its guiding principle, the movie follows the lives of a bunch of characters who are struggling to lead a better life in the metropolis. Stories of hope and resilience set in the densely populated Mumbai are not new for movie-lovers. But the film shifts its focus to the loneliness of the elderly to offer a fresh take about the cityâ€™s aloofness as well as generosity.
At the beginning of the movie, we meet widower Kamath (Jackie Shroff) trying to lead a disciplined life. By the end of the day, however, gnawing loneliness takes over, making him almost give up on life until he comes across another lonely soul in the city, Prakash Kaur Handa (Nina Gupta). Unlike surly Kamath, Prakash is spirited. She is happy-go-lucky, makes inappropriate jokes and uses expletives.

"â€œKya re? Setting-ah? Vengaiyan mavan othaila nikken. Dhillrundha mothama vaangalae (What is it guys? All set, is it? Vengaiyanâ€™s son is here standing all alone. Bring it on, if you all have it in you),â€ proclaimed Rajinikanth in the teaser of Kaala five years ago that sent the whole of Tamil Nadu into a frenzy. The scene quickly became the much-anticipated part of the film as everyone wanted to know what would ensue after the heroic scream of Superstar Rajinikanth. Andâ€¦ it turned out to be a damp squib in the movie as the scene ended up in an anti-climax. As the rowdies close in, Kaalaâ€™s (Rajinikanth) elder son swoops in and what could have been an epic fight sequence settles down with no fizz. The whole set-up was an easy way to get the audience going. It is a no-brainer. Had it been directed by any other filmmaker, it would have become a perfect battlefield that would have left Rajinikanth fans in euphoria. On top of that, Pa Ranjith had Santhosh Narayananâ€™s raging â€œKatravai Patravaiâ€ at his disposal. Why then did Ranjith refuse to pull the trigger? Perhaps, the director is a pleasure-delayer because we get all that high later in the â€˜Rain fightâ€™, which ends up becoming the interval block. On top of it, it is Ranjithâ€™s way of saying he is not going to play it for the gallery. It is his way of saying it is not about the Vengaiyan Mavan but the film.
When Kaala was released, a predominant narrative about the film was that it was neither Rajinikanthâ€™s film nor Pa Ranjithâ€™s. The heroism or the so-called â€˜mass momentsâ€™ were nuanced for the fans who have seen their Thalaivar stop bullets with his gaze. On the other hand, the critics of the director claimed he has â€˜compromisedâ€™ his values to accommodate the superstar. While both criticisms hold water to an extent, in retrospect, Kaala remains predominantly a vision of Ranjith more than a star vehicle. One has to only compare the film with the subsequent Rajinikanth ventures to understand how different Kaala is from the likes of Jailer or Annaatthe. The comparison is not to put down masala cinema, but to bring out the difference between them and Kaala.

"With a career as timeless as the golden era of Bollywood, Dharmendra has etched his journey in the reel of our hearts and the legendary actor is celebrating his birthday today.  His journey speaks volumes of an era where the â€˜He-Manâ€™ of Bollywood took center stage. The actorâ€™s journey began in 1960 when Arjun Hingorani signed him for Dil Bhi Tera, Hum Bhi Tere as the lead, marking his debut as a hero for a meager Rs 51. Widely known as â€˜Garam Dharam,â€™ Dharmendra became a busy star by the late 60s. 
With over 300 films to his name, including hits like Phool Aur Patthar, Sholay, Pratigya, Mera Gaon Mera Desh, and Chupke Chupke, he left an everlasting mark on the industry. Despite his prolific career, Dharmendra received only one Filmfare award early in his career for Best Talent, followed by a lifetime achievement award towards the end.

"â€œChildren donâ€™t count,â€ spits a man who has clearly forgotten that he used to be a child himself. This man is Mr Dawson, a middle-aged politician who has been sweet-talked into corruption by a big businessman named Hiram Lodge. Heâ€™s the one effectively running things, while elected officials like Dawson serve as glorified stooges under his iron fist. Sounds familiar? In her new film, The Archies, director Zoya Akhtar disguises her political angst by unleashing a charm-offensive as irresistible as that memorable piece to camera in Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Jawan.
Set in a semi-fantastical hill station in 1964, The Archies isnâ€™t merely a superficial nostalgia trip (although Gold Spot and Bata make cameo appearances in several scenes). The movieâ€™s bigger achievement is reminding a certain generation â€” the boomers, or, as we like to call them, the uncles â€” that before spending their afternoons fighting over parking spots and voting right-wing governments into power, they actually cared â€” about the environment, about free speech, about democracy. In its own good-natured way, The Archies is something that only Javed Akhtarâ€™s daughter couldâ€™ve made, but more to the point, itâ€™s a movie that will likely be about as triggering to fans of Animal as Sandeep Reddy Vangaâ€™s blockbuster has been to his detractors.

His smile, the way he speaks, those dimples that feel like I could drown in them.

"The Hindi film industry has had a great year at the box office after a string of flops in recent years. It started with the success of Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s actioner Pathaan, which was released in January and earned over Rs 1000 crore at the box office. Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap recently credited Shah Rukh for â€˜lifting the curseâ€™ from Bollywood.
In an interaction with Pinkvilla, Kashyap recapped Bollywoodâ€™s box office performance this year and said, â€œI think it has been great. Bollywoodâ€™s curse is lifted which is very good news because distributors are happy, studios are happy, everybody is happy. When they are happy, I know my projects will get greenlit.â€

"Ram Gopal Varma has been praising Ranbir Kapoorâ€™s Animal ever since the film released in theatres. Recently, the Satya director shared his review of the film on X. RGV even went on to say that he would like to touch filmmaker Sandeep Reddy Vanga and Ranbirâ€™s feet for making the movie. Now, in an interview, Varma opened up on different aspects of the film, what he liked and disliked, and critics panning it for glorifying toxic masculinity.
Speaking on how critics are calling out Animal for being a violent and misogynistic film, RGV told Connect FM Canada, â€œThatâ€™s the nature of a violent film and the director has been saying that from the beginning. â€˜You will see what violence is,â€™ he had said. So you are pre-warned even in trailer and interviews. And then to call it violent, I find it funny. See the whole point of a film is to startle you and to provoke an emotion. Shock is one of the emotions. Many times I was surprised in the film, but it can be an unpleasant surprise to some people and when sudden shock comes, it disorients them.â€

"Actor Triptii Dimri, who appeared in a brief but memorable scene in the recent blockbuster Animal, spoke about the controversy that the film has generated, and praised Ranbir Kapoor for being sensitive to her needs on set. Directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, Animal is on its way to becoming Ranbirâ€™s biggest-ever hit, but has also been criticised for its depiction of misogyny.
In an interview with ETimes, Triptii, who has previously starred in the Netflix films Qala and Bulbbul, said that she found some of the reactions that the film has been receiving to be â€˜disturbingâ€™ and also addressed the â€˜leakâ€™ of an intimate scene from the film, in which she is shown to be partially nude. Triptii said that the rape scene she filmed for Bulbbul was â€˜more challengingâ€™ to prepare for. The intimate scene in Animal, she said, â€˜was nothing in comparisonâ€™ to the Bulbbul scene.

"Devashish Makhija makes movies about people on the margins, compelled to switch on their survival mode in the face of great odds. His fourth feature â€˜Joramâ€™ reunites him with Manoj Bajpayee who was terrific as a retired low-level policeman in â€˜Bhonsleâ€™: here, the latter plays a tribal on the run, keeping at bay inimical forces from within his own people, as well as those who are hunting him from the outside. Is there anyone left on his side?
Dasru Kerketta (Bajpayee) and Vaano (Chatterjee) are forced to leave behind an idyllic life in their Jharkhand village, and move to a concrete construction in Mumbai. A violent killing, in which Dasru is made to participate, is the catalyst for their flight. But five years on, coming face-to-face with the formidable tribal leader Phulo Karma (Tambe) sets into motion a series of terrible events, which sees Dasru fleeing with his three-month-old baby daughter named Joram."
"Shah Rukh Khan has been in the movies for 30 years now but before that, the actor started his journey from the world of television. SRK worked in TV shows like Fauji, Circus among many others and soon became an actor to watch out for. In a recent conversation with Mukesh Khanna, veteran actor Aanjjan Srivastav shared that Shah Rukh was an â€œinquisitiveâ€ actor even in those early days.
Aanjjan recalled the time when Shah Rukh would frequently collaborate with Aziz Mirza and Kundan Shah, and recalled that before he became a movie actor, he was offered a small role in the TV show Wagle Ki Duniya. The Doordarshan show was extremely popular at the time and made Aanjjan a household name. He recalled, â€œHe was offered a small role in Wagle Ki Duniya. He jumped on the offer and said Iâ€™ll do it, just tell me what to do.â€ Aanjjan recalled that he initially wanted another actor for the part but when he worked with SRK, he was in awe of his talent. â€œHe was not a star at the time and he had such sportsman spirit,â€ he said.

"Even Superstar Rajinikanthâ€™s residence in one of the most affluent areas of Chennai was not spared by the devastating Cyclone Michaung and the subsequent flood. A video shot by a fan depicts a water-stagnated road in front of the Superstarâ€™s house. The entire road is submerged in water after the last spell of rain.
Fans online have expressed shock over the state of affairs, with one user commenting, â€œThalaivarkae indha nilamaiya? (Even Thalaivar is in such a bad state).â€

According to reports, Rajinikanth is not in town as he has left for Tirunelveli for the shoot of his upcoming film, Thalaivar 170, directed by TJ Gnanavel. His family has also shifted to a different location from the Poes Garden house.
While actor Vijay has come up with a statement about the sad state of Chennai and asked his organisation members to work with the government to help the needy, Rajinikanth is yet to address the issue. 
On Tuesday, Bollywood superstar Aamir Khan was rescued from Chennaiâ€™s Karappakkam area along with Tamil actor Vishnu Vishal. Vishal shared the pictures of Aamir with the volunteers, which went viral on social media as people were surprised to find Aamir in the city. 
Actors Namitha, Vinodhini Vaidhyanathan, Aditi Balan, Shanthanu, and Aathmika are among other Tamil actors who were affected by the floods. While the rain has stopped, the stagnant water is yet to recede from many places in the city despite the governmentâ€™s efforts. Union Minister Rajnath Singh is visiting Chennai on Friday to assess the situation.

On the work front, Rajinikanth is busy with Thalaivar 170, which also has Amitabh Bachchan, Fahadh Faasil, and Rana Daggubati in important roles. Rajinikanth will next team up with Lokesh Kanagaraj for a yet-untitled film, which will go on floors in April 2024."

Fun in the sense itâ€™ not comic but it was genuinely a lot of fun because I couldnâ€™t meet for two years because of Covid, so I met them literally like the week before marriage and we had a party at my place.

"Zoya Akhtarâ€™s directorial The Archies, which marks the debut of star kids Suhana Khan, Khushi Kapoor and Agastya Nanda, premiered on Netflix on Thursday. Zoyaâ€™s brother Farhan Akhtar and father Javed Akhtar have also made substantial contributions to Zoyaâ€™s directorial. While Javed wrote the lyrics of the album, the Hindi dialogues of the film came from Farhan.
Speaking about working with her brother, Zoya told News18, â€œThe Hindi dialogues came from Farhan. He took a blueprint and made it into his syntax and the syntax of that particular language and the simplicity of the Archie comics. Getting the corniness and humour of the comics was tough but he brought that out really well. He was the one who introduced the phrase â€˜Va Va Voomâ€™ from the comics into the song.â€

"In Riverdale, a small sylvan Indian town with a large Anglo-Indian community, everyone knows everyone. It is 1964, a time of innocence, a time of confidences. Clean-faced teenagers flit about doing teenager stuff, strumming guitars in the high-school band, making eyes and flirting and dating â€” the good-looking Archie Andrews, the pretty Betty Cooper, the sassy Veronica Lodge, the always-hungry Jughead Jones, the cocky Reggie Mantle, the likeable but dull Moose, the sensible Ethel â€” as the adults, including the beloved Pop Tate who runs the cafeteria with its big burgers and tall shakes, go about their business.
This brand new Netflix iteration of the Archie comics, which began printing in the US in 1941, and held such sway in select urban Indian pockets in the 70s and 80s, was always going to be judged on one count. Will this fresh cast, headlined by Agastya Nanda as Archie, Khushi Kapoor as Betty, and Suhana Khan as Veronica, will be able to pull off those madly popular characters?
For the virulent anti-Bollywood gang, this trio is nothing but Nepotism Central. I am here to say that these kids arenâ€™t terrible. If I had to choose, Iâ€™d say Khushi has more verve than both Agastya and Suhana, but I will also say that the latter did grow on me: she has her fatherâ€™s dimple, and she did manage the arched eyebrow, haughty-miss expression a few times.
ADVERTISEMENT
And the others are just fine, especially the bright-as-a-tack Dilton (Yuvraj Menda) who represents the kind of boy who likes other boys, Mihir Ahuja as Archieâ€™s loyal pal Juggie, and Vedang Raina as the too-smart-by-half Reggie. I also liked that none of the kids is singled out for special treatment; they all get to share screen space equitably.
As readers who devoured these comics so high on all-American values, we know that it is easy-paced nostalgia of that era that Zoya Akhtar is going for, and the film does get in some of that feeling it its choice of apparel and hair-styles: skirts and pixie bob-cuts and high-waisted pants. And coming-of-age stories never get old: remember how we scoffed at the â€˜high-schoolâ€™ that Karan Joharâ€™s self-confessed Archies-Riverdale prototype created in his â€˜Kuch Kuch Hota Haiâ€™, and yet fell for the mix, because who could resist the high-wattage charm of SRK as Archie, Kajol as Betty and Rani as Veronica even though they looked way older than teenagers, and even though they were horribly politically incorrect even at the time?
The other thing that the film gets right is in the way it looks, which isnâ€™t a surprise coming from Zoya Akhtar, Reema Kagti and co, whose production values are always top-notch. The lavish Lodge residence, in which Aly Khan plays the big businessman with an eye on the green lung of Riverdale, the sprawling, leafy Green Park, the restful book-shop, the newspaper office, the hair-dressers, are all spot on. The tricky balance between the comic-book aspect, and the real-life feel is right.

But what isnâ€™t, is the film itself. Only a couple of songs stand out: the opening one has real lilt. The plot does give us a sense of the world at the time â€” a sit-in at the beloved Green Park which the townspeople are trying to save from greedy capitalists foreshadows the Woodstock protest, the local newspaper stands up for the right of free expression, same-sex love is hinted at, and a song goes â€˜Everything Is Politicalâ€™ â€” but overall, the writing isnâ€™t perky enough.
The kids are all right. The film is a bland bauble.

Looks like Naga Chaitanya is playing a fisherman in the film, which is directed by Chandoo Mondeti, known for his hit films Karthikeya and Karthikeya 2. This marks his third collaboration with the actor. The two have earlier worked together in the Telugu remake of the hit Malayalam film Premam and Savyaasachi. Both their previous collaborations have only yielded mediocre results.
The film is also an important one in Naga Chaitanyaâ€™s career as he has not delivered a hit in the past few years. His last film Custody, which raised expectations, turned out to be another flop in his career.
Other than Naga Chaitanya, the film also has Sai Pallavi in the lead role. Devi Sri Prasad is composing music for the film, which is produced by Allu Aravindâ€™s Geetha Arts. Other cast details and the release date of the film are yet to be unveiled."
"Fans of director David Fincherâ€™s recent Netflix film, The Killer, was left astonished on Wednesday, as the visual effects house Wylie Co. VFX shared a video breakdown of a sequence in which the central character was revealed to have been entirely computer generated. Fincherâ€™s films are known for their invisble effects, and in a thread posted on X, Wylie Co said that its â€˜ultimate goalâ€™ with the sequence was to ensure that nobody notices that the protagonist is a CGI creation.
The sequence in question takes place early in the film, after the titular assassin, played by Michael Fassbender, botches a hit-job and flees the scene of the crime. He jumps onto a scooter and races to safety along the streets of Paris at nighttime. The breakdown video revealed that Fassbender was fully computer-generated in the sequence, including close-up shots of his face, behind a helmet.

"As Shah Rukh Khanâ€˜s Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman turned 31, his co-star, actor Viveck Vaswani has opened up about the time when the superstar was reluctant to work in movies initially because he would have to hug girls and his wife, Gauri Khan, had forbidden him from doing so. Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman was helmed by Aziz Mirza. Along with SRK the 1992 film also starred Juhi Chawla, Amrita Singh, Viveck Vaswani among others.

When he returned to Mumbai after his mother died and he said â€˜Letâ€™s do a filmâ€™, I had to say â€˜yesâ€™. Until then, he preferred to work only in TV. He was against films.

But today I woke up feeling like a WOW, so I had to click a selfie.â€ Bhumi asked her Instagram family to be careful of mosquitos and keep their immunity high. She wrote, â€œGuys be careful, cause the last few days were extremely tough for my family and I. Mosquito repellentâ€™s are a must right now. Keep your immunity up. High pollution levels have most of our immunities compromised. Quite a few people I know have gotten dengue recently. Yet again ek invisible virus ne halat kharab kar di :).â€

As the song unfolds, glimpses from various phases of his life are depicted, showcasing his charisma and unwavering determination.

"Director Anurag Kashyap said that he was â€˜heartbrokenâ€™ when Phantom Films, the production company he co-ran with filmmakers Vikramaditya Motwane, Vikas Bahl and Madhu Mantena, closed down following the #MeToo allegations against Bahl. But he bottled up his emotions and doubled down on work, which affected his health adversely. In a new interview, Anurag said that he has taken steps to take back control of his life, which includes shutting out people and isolating himself.
For the longest time, he said on Flip the Script with Shubra podcast, he would welcome strugglers into his house and offer his mentorship to anybody in need of it. But how can you give water to somebody with an empty glass, he reasoned in the interview, explaining why he made the decision to focus on himself, and what that implies. â€œMy house had a lot of rooms, and every time somebody was passing through, theyâ€™d stay there. I broke all the rooms. Thereâ€™s only one room.â€

In a recent interview, Ranbir has shared how his character in the film is similar yet different from Arjun Reddy and Kabir Singh, the infamous protagonists of Vanga. He also shared that Animal is a film which will keep the audience at the edge of their seats.
While speaking to Variety, Ranbir clarified that the reason he chose to do Animal was not the success of Vangaâ€™s previous films, Arjun Reddy and Kabir Singh. Instead, it was the script of the film. However, he did enjoy watching Arjun Reddy and Kabir Singh.

"When Warner Bros announced that it wasnâ€™t going to release the completed Batgirl film and was instead going cut losses with a tax write-off, the move was described as unprecedented. The studio had already spent nearly $100 million on the superhero movie. WB did the same thing again recently with the Coyote vs Acme film, and this time, the industry didnâ€™t stay quiet. Faced with growing pressure, the studio allowed the filmmakers to shop Coyote vs Acme around to other interested distributors, instead of letting it sit on a shelf. But decision-making like this has been common in the Indian streaming industry, the Washington Post recently reported.
Streaming platforms such as Netflix and Prime Video ask for extensive changes to be made to stories involving politics, caste, and religion, when they arenâ€™t â€˜politely passingâ€™ on the projects altogether. â€œWhy greenlight it, then change your mind?â€ asked Anurag Kashyap, whose magnum opus three-part adaptation of Suketu Mehtaâ€™s Maximum City was abandoned by Netflix, sending him into a depressive spiral.

"The Chennai city police have booked actor Mansoor Ali Khan for allegedly making derogatory remarks against actor Trisha Krishnan, police said.
Nungambakkam Police has booked the actor under Sections 354 A (sexual harassment) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to outrage the modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code. The action was taken following an order of Director-General of Police Shankar Jiwal.
Only in Express | Mansoor Ali Khanâ€™s remarks about Trisha are part of a broader pattern; men in film industry have consistently been misogynistic
Taking suo motu cognisance of the matter, the National Commission for Women had issued a direction to the Tamil Nadu police to register a case against the actor.
ADVERTISEMENT
A video of Mansoor Ali Khan from one of his interviews had surfaced on social media, where he had said he hoped to have a rape scene in Leo starring Trisha just like he had in older films with stars like Khushboo and Roja.
â€œWhen I heard that I was acting with Trisha, I thought there would be a bedroom scene in the film. I thought that I could carry her to the bedroom just like I did with other actresses in my earlier movies. I have done so many rape scenes in a number of movies and itâ€™s not new to me. But these guys didnâ€™t even show Trisha to me on the sets during the Kashmir scheduleâ€ Khan had purportedly said.

Trisha and Mansoor Ali Khan donâ€™t share screen space in Lokesh Kanagarajâ€™s film Leo but have portrayed prominent roles in the film.
Responding to Khanâ€™s remarks, Trisha took to microblogging site X and wrote, â€œA recent video has come to my notice where Mr Mansoor Ali Khan has spoken about me in a vile and disgusting manner. I strongly condemn this and find it sexist, disrespectful, misogynistic, repulsive and in bad taste. He can keep wishing but I am grateful never to have shared screen space with someone as pathetic as him and I will make sure it never happens for the rest of my film career as well. People like him bring a bad name to mankind.â€"

"Salman Khan was hoping to capture the South Indian market with Tiger 3. But even though that didnâ€™t happen, the action-thriller is playing like a South tent-pole at the box office, only in the north. Tiger 3 is proving to be quite front-loaded, and like so many major Tamil hits, itâ€™s running out of steam in less than two weeks of release. On day 10 in theatres, Tiger 3 added Rs 6.3 crore to its domestic total, according to industry tracker Sacnilk.
The action-thriller has now made Rs 243 crore in India, and will cross the Rs 250 crore mark either today or tomorrow. While this is a significant feat, especially for Salman, who hasnâ€™t delivered an outright hit since 2017â€™s Tiger Zinda Hai, the filmâ€™s bloated budget must be taken into account. Tiger 3 reportedly cost Rs 300 crore to produce, and will be lucky to pass the Rs 500 crore mark globally by the end of its theatrical run. The movieâ€™s current global gross recently passed the Rs 400 crore mark, according to analyst Manobala Vijayabalan.

"I was looking for a subtle way to say this, but since the recent action thrillers in the Hindi cinema have been anything but subtle, I will put it plainly: Jawan gave me a headache. Too harsh? Hear me out. Jawan paraded a familiar narrative: a villain named Kalee (Vijay Sethupathi), a global arms dealer, a son (Azad, played by Shah Rukh Khan) seeking retribution for his supposedly deceased father (Vikram Rathore, also portrayed by SRK), unjustly branded a traitor to the nation. Meanwhile, the sonâ€™s grieving mother (Deepika Padukone) faces societyâ€™s harsh judgment. This film was a concoction of patriotism and on-the-nose messaging, essentially wrapping an outdated â€™90s storyline in the sheen of modernity â€”high-tech slow-motion shots, sleek cinematography, and sophisticated graphics â€” served up for the 2023 audience.
Donâ€™t believe me? I recently got a chance to watch Bobby Deolâ€™s Soldier, the 1998 action thriller, that reminded me a lot of Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Jawan. Celebrating its 25th anniversary this week, Soldier features Bobby Deol as Vicky, the son of a deceased Army officer, embarking on a vendetta to avenge his father, falsely accused of treachery. His ostracised mother seeks solace in a temple, shunned by society. The filmâ€™s antagonists are responsible for slandering Vickyâ€™s father, in the same way that Kalee besmirched Azadâ€™s father, Vikram Rathore, in Jawan.

"Choreographer Saroj Khanâ€™s illustrious career as a dance guru in Bollywood redefined dancing in Hindi films. Several of the leading actresses such as Madhuri Dixit, Aishwarya Rai and Sridevi did some of their most memorable songs with her. Saroj, who passed away in 2020, has composed dance moves in a plethora of films and one such memorable track was â€œDhak Dhakâ€ from the film Beta. The song was choreographed on Anil Kapoor and Madhuri, which also gave the latter the title of â€˜Dhak Dhak girlâ€™. However, not many know that Central Board of Film Certification wanted to chop down scenes from the song, as they deemed the dance steps to be deliberately provocative and not appropriate for audience back then.
In a documentary, The Saroj Khan Story made by The Public Service Broadcasting Trust (PSBT) in 2012, the choreographer explained the conversation she had with CBFC members. She explained that the board members had problem with the dance steps, and especially a scene where Madhuri is seen sitting down.

"In the decade-and-change since Bryan Lee Oâ€™Malleyâ€™s landmark Scott Pilgrim comic book series ended its run, the notion of Manic Pixie Dream Girls skating into the lives of layabout young men and igniting a spark inside the depths of their disillusioned souls has become obsolete. Some would say correctly. A live-action film adaptation, directed by Edgar Wright and released in 2010, perfectly captured this millennial malaise, retaining the comic bookâ€™s irreverent humour and, in a great example of the Mandela Effect, giving the impression that it was painted in the most vivid colours imaginable â€” it was actually in black and white.
Over a decade after the film earned cult status after crumbling at the box office, Netflix has unveiled an eight-episode anime series with Oâ€™Malley at the helm alongside BenDavid Grabinski. Nothing â€” not the marketing material, the disarmingly familiar opening episode, even the much-publicised decision to get each cast member from the live-action movie to return â€” can prepare you for the sheer burst of originality that youâ€™re in for, especially if youâ€™ve been a fan of the series. Scott Pilgrim Takes Off isnâ€™t a remake; it isnâ€™t even a reboot or a re-quel. It takes the same premise â€” a slacker from Toronto somehow â€˜pataosâ€™ a girl whoâ€™s clearly out of his league â€” and branches off into a different realm altogether.

"Actor Sara Ali Khan on Tuesday said her upcoming movie Ae Watan Mere Watan is a timeless story of Indiaâ€™s freedom struggle that has the ability to inspire the current generation.
Directed by Kannan Iyer, the period drama is backed by Dharmatic Entertainment Production, and produced by Karan Johar, Apoorva Mehta and Somen Mishra.
The makers presented an exclusive showcase of the thriller drama film, inspired by true events, at the ongoing 54th edition of International Film Festival of India (IFFI).
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œThis is a film based on the Indian freedom struggle, but it is a timeless story. The current generation should take inspiration from this. The freedom struggle ended in 1947 but even after that, as a woman, child, and actor everyone struggles. We should find inspiration within ourselves,â€ Sara Ali Khan told reporters on the sidelines of IFFI.
As a history student, the actor said, the film turned out to be an interesting opportunity. The movie is written by Darab Farooqui and Kannan Iyer.

â€œI am a history student. Also, time travel wonâ€™t be possible so how will I go to the Quit India Movement and relive those emotions that people faced at that point of timeâ€¦ I have got this chance by doing this movie,â€ she said.
The makers today also conducted a session on â€œDrawing inspiration from history to create an immersive cinematic experience for todayâ€™s audiencesâ€.

Iyer said while the team has taken creative liberties to make the story engaging, they have remained true to the essence of actual events that took place during the Quit India Movement of 1942.
â€œI would like to share that Sara has been so open to every nuance of the character she plays. She is a modern young woman, who transformed into the part so seamlessly. I would like to thank her for being on this journey with me,â€ he added.
Karan Johar said, â€œAe Watan Mere Watan is an inspiring story that needed to be told. We have tried to tell some stories, inspired by true events that have spoken volumes about the love for our country, and this film is that. We are very excited to be here at IFFI, for the audience to catch a glimpse of this film that will be premiering next year.â€
The film will premiere on Prime Video in India and other global territories.

"Rana Daggubati and Venkatesh made their streaming debut with the much-hyped Rana Naidu on Netflix earlier this year. While the show received some diverse reactions from the audience, the second season has already been greenlit by the streamer. Speaking about the second season of the Ray Donovan adaptation, Venkatesh said, at a recent event in Hyderabad, that the second season wonâ€™t offend anyone.
The first season of Rana Naidu was disliked by some Telugu fans for its crude language. Venkatesh addressed it and said, â€œThis time, I will be much more careful. I intend not to offend anyone this time. Last time, people from our region got affected, but, I assure you, this time it will be good. However, it will have a tinge of mischief.â€

"As the release date of Dhruva Natchathiram is nearing, Gautham Menon has become increasingly active in pushing his film across all platforms. Amidst scepticism that the movie will not release as per Gauthamâ€™s announcement, the director is staying valiant. Though GVM has noted that he has been fighting this battle alone, in a recent interview, he revealed that he had a few people who have stood by him. The filmmaker-actor cited music composers AR Rahman and Harrish Jeyaraj as examples.
Talking about Harris, he told Galatta Tamil, â€œWhen I went to Harris and showed the film, he could have very well said no. I am going to him after a long while. But he encouraged me and said, â€˜It is very different from what you have done.â€™ He asked me if he can add one more song to the film on top of â€˜Oru Manamâ€™ because thatâ€™s the only one we have shot. I said, â€˜Please Harris we can go musically in a lot of places.â€™ He has made a whole fight sequence with a song. He also put out a word about the film which has also helped it. He didnâ€™t have to do all that.â€"

As Ekta took the stage to receive the award, she spoke about her journey as a producer from the time she and her mother Shobha Kapoor started their company Balaji Telefilms in father Jeetendraâ€™s garage.
Ekta said that she and mother started their company when she was only 18 and for the first 7-8 years of her career, they were known as â€œlady producersâ€ as this was a male dominated space at the time. â€œThe irony is the worldâ€™s population is solely produced by women,â€ she said as the crowd chuckled in agreement. Ekta then proceeded to thank her brother Tusshar Kapoor and father Jeetendra as they were babysitting her son Ravi.

"Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Dunki is all set to release in December and like most of his co-stars, one of his co-actors in Dunki, Ajay Kumar, recently showered the superstar with a lot of compliments for his professionalism and his strong work ethic. In a recent interview, Ajay said that he only had a two-and-a-half-minute scene with Shah Rukh, and for that, the star rehearsed for over six hours with him and did not sit down even for a minute. They tried over 25 variations until they got to the best possible outcome.
The actor told Dainik Bhaskar, â€œItâ€™s said about stars that as soon as the shoot breaks, they head to their vanity vans or start relaxing. Not Shah Rukh. Believe it or not, our communication scene is just two and a half minutes long. But for that scene to be perfect, Shah Rukh put in a total of six hours of hard work. He continued shooting until 7 in the evening. Even during a 10-minute break between shots for lighting changes, he wouldnâ€™t sit down; he kept rehearsing. Though he had only four lines, he kept rehearsing them.â€

Producer K. E. Gnanavel Raja recently shared his ambitious goal of expanding the filmâ€™s marketing and distribution to new territories, thereby opening doors to unparalleled box office success and broader international reach for Tamil cinema. Gnanavel, in a recent interview with Behindwoods, said, â€œWe are trying to cross many borders that have not been crossed by Tamil industry. If everything goes as per our plans, the film will make an unprecedented number and it would open more doors for Tamil cinema.â€"
"Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Jawan has been the biggest grosser in Indian cinema in 2023. The film grossed over Rs 1100 crore at the global box office but after its release on Netflix, the film has set new benchmarks. The Atlee directorial released in theatres on September 7, and almost three months later, on November 2, the film released on the streaming platform with an â€˜extended cutâ€™.

In a statement, Shah Rukh expressed his joy with Jawan being the â€˜most watched film in Indiaâ€™. â€œI am thrilled to share that Jawan is the most watched film in India on Netflix. Releasing the extended version was our way of expressing gratitude to our fans for extending their unwavering love and support to the film. The overwhelming response weâ€™ve received from Netflix audiences only reaffirms the brilliance of Indian cinema. Jawan is not just a film; itâ€™s a celebration of storytelling, passion, and the vibrant spirit of our cinema and I couldnâ€™t be prouder of its success on Netflix,â€ he said.
Also starring Nayanthara, Deepika Padukone, Vijay Sethupathi, Priyamani, Sanya Malhotra, Jawan became the second hit for SRK this year. Earlier this year, Shah Rukh was seen in Pathaan which also grossed over Rs 1000 crore at the global box office. The actor is now looking forward to Dunki.

"The year 2023 has been the year of Shah Rukh Khan. SRK dominated Bollywood with two monumental blockbusters â€” Pathaan and Jawan â€”successfully reviving the industry post-pandemic. The much-anticipated film Dunki awaits its release, adding to SRKâ€™s exceptional year. While SRK commits his heart to every project, he revealed that he did only one film in his career for money. The actor shared the same during his appearance on the 2016 talk show Yaaron Ki Baraat.
During the discussion, SRK didnâ€™t disclose the filmâ€™s name but confessed to doing just one movie solely for financial reasons. He said, â€œMein naam nahi lunga par sirf ek film maine paise ke liye ki thi. Maine abhi tak 60 films ki hai. Aur mujh malum bhi tha, maine producer ko bhi bol dia tha, maine ghar liya tha uss film ki fees se, mujh bahut zaroorat thi. Jab mere halaat theek-thak hogae, toh jab maine recently apni saare films vapas kharedna shuru kia, woh pehli film thi jo maine vapas li, mujh aisa lagta hai ki maine uss film ki payment vapas ki hai (I will not take its name, but I have only done one film for money. I have done 60 films till now. I bought my first house from the fees of that film. I needed that money. But when I got financial stability and I started buying my films, that was the first film I bought. I feel I have returned the payment of that film).â€
He added, â€œMujhe dil nahi tha woh film karneka, par maine ek he film aaj tak apna zameer bhechke paisa ke liye ki hai (I didnâ€™t have the heart to do that film, but that was the only film for which I sold my conscience for money).â€

When asked which celebrity would find a place in her house in a framed poster, Kareena took a pause and said, â€œItâ€™s a toss up actually. Nick Jonas or Ranveer Singh.â€ And when asked what would always be in her fridge, Kareena gave a smile and said, â€œBotox.â€ Clips from her conversation are going around on social media and not many know that Kareena was supposed to give wrong answers for these questions.

"Tamil actor Mansoor Ali Khan has refused to apologies for his objectionable comments about Trisha and other actors. Despite emphatic criticism of his statement, the actor announced in a press conference that he will not say sorry as there was nothing wrong with what he said. He claimed his statement was misconstrued.
In an earlier press interaction, the actor said that he has done many rape scenes with heroines in his career, but in Leo he was not even able to get a glimpse of his co-star Trisha. This shocked not just Tamil actors, but even Telugu superstar Chiranjeevi came down heavily as he criticised the statement. Nadigar Sangam (the South Indian Artistesâ€™ Association) issued a temporary ban on the actor and the National Commission for Women took suo moto cognisance of the matter.

"Following the Tandav controversy, several web shows and films slated for release on various streaming platforms were either shelved or had to be reworked. Anurag Kashyapâ€™s adaptation of Suketu Mehtaâ€™s Maximum City for Netflix was one such project. Just before entering pre-production, Netflix withdrew from the project, citing cautiousness amidst the countryâ€™s political climate.
In a recent interview with The Washington Post, Kashyap discussed the significance of Maximum City, calling it his best work and emphasising its importance. He expressed disappointment over the self-censorship adopted by streaming platforms post the Tandav controversy, referring to it as a form of â€œinvisible censorshipâ€.

"Yash Raj Filmsâ€™ digital arm YRF Entertainmentâ€™s first-ever Netflix series, The Railway Men, was released on Saturday. Starring Kay Kay Menon, R Madhavan, Babil Khan, and Divyenndu in the lead roles, the series is based on the 1984 Bhopal Gas Tragedy. When YRF first offered Kay Kay Menon a role in the show, he didnâ€™t trust the banner with handling the serious subject matter, given their history of making â€œgood lookingâ€ films.
During a recent chat with Neelesh Misra posted on Netflix Indiaâ€™s YouTube channel, Menon revisited his first call with YRF for The Railway Men. He shared, â€œWhen I got a call from Yash Raj Films, I thought it would be one of those films which they usually do, which are good-looking. But then they told me it is about Bhopal Gas Tragedy.

"Actor Amit Sadh said that he is a huge fan of Hollywood star Johnny Depp, who served as a symbol of strength to him in his early Bollywood days when people tried to â€œchangeâ€ him. Sadh, who shot to fame with Kai Po Che, co-starring Sushant Singh Rajput and Rajkummar Rao, called Depp an â€œamazing manâ€ and narrated why the Hollywood star matters to him.
In the latest episode of the Jist Unscripted podcast, Sadh opened about his struggles in the film industry, and said that he isnâ€™t bothered about cancel culture. â€œI have gained a lot of strength (from Depp) because when I was starting Kai Po Che, many people tried to change me. Ho sakta hai mere baal kharab ho, meri shakal kharab ho but I had a voice within me which said if everyone looked the same, then everyone would have to do the same role. I had that strength in me that donâ€™t try to change me, I will be who I am,â€ he said.

"Actor Kartik Aaryan was credited as a producer on Shehzada, a remake of Allu Arjunâ€™s hit Telugu film Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo, because he sacrificed some of his wages to ensure that it sees the light of day. The film was released earlier this year but failed to impress the audience, and tanked at the box office. Recently, the actor revealed he was â€˜notâ€™ a â€˜properâ€™ producer of the film, and was credited as one because of the graciousness of the actual producers, and because he helped make sure that it didnâ€™t stall due to a â€˜money crisisâ€™.
While speaking to Film Companion, Kartik revealed, â€œI was not a producer-producer as such. I was given that credit on the basis that the film was going into a money crisis, and I gave up on my fees. I also gave some money so that the structure could be made and the film doesnâ€™t get stuck.â€ He added that he was â€˜just acting as a producerâ€™, and said, â€œThe producers were gracious enough that they credited me (as a producer) for that reason.â€ Going forward, Kartik has no plans to produce a film and is only focused on his acting career.

"No conversation about cricket in the country can happen without the mention of Mumbaiâ€™s iconic Wankhede stadium, and every mention of the stadium is incomplete without invoking the infamous fight that broke out there involving superstar Shah Rukh Khan. Shah Rukh was banned for five years from entering MCA premises, including the Wankhede Stadium, after he was involved in an altercation with security staff and officials of the cricket body in 2012. The ban was lifted three years later.

My kids were there and I thought someoneâ€¦ Maybe they had a rule, that hatao yaha se. I told him, these are our kids and we are taking them. I just said this. There was a person there who said a word which I, as a Delhi person, felt like it was an abusive word. Even though the same word in Marathi is also rude. Thoda sa religious, galat tha woh (It was religious, it was wrong). I then lost my cool, main pagal hogaya and I went to hit him,â€ the superstar recalled.

"After Trisha called out actor Mansoor Ali Khan for his derogatory remarks about her, several celebrities rallied in support of the Ponniyin Selvan actor. The latest to support Trisha is Telugu star Chiranjeevi, who said that Mansoorâ€™s words are â€˜reprehensibleâ€™.
Earlier, Trisha had vowed to never work with Mansoor after his lewd comments about her at a press conference. Mansoor spoke in Tamil during the interaction, and said, â€œWhen I heard that I was acting with Trisha, I thought there would be a bedroom scene in the film. I thought I would carry her to the bedroom just like I did with other actresses in my earlier movies. I have done so many rape scenes and itâ€™s not new to me. But these guys didnâ€™t even show Trisha to me on the sets during the shoot in Kashmir.â€

Trisha replied to the Bholaa Shankar actor by writing, â€œThank you Chiru sirâ€. Chiranjeeviâ€™s tweet comes after Trishaâ€™s Leo director Lokesh Kanagaraj also called out Mansoor. He wrote, â€œDisheartened and enraged to hear the misogynistic comments made by Mr.Mansoor Ali Khan, given that we all worked in the same team. Respect for women, fellow artists and professionals should be a non-negotiable in any industry and I absolutely condemn this behaviour.â€
Trisha had slammed Mansoor for his comments by writing on social media, â€œA recent video has come to my notice where Mr. Mansoor Ali Khan has spoken about me in a vile and disgusting manner. I strongly condemn this and find it sexist, disrespectful, misogynistic, repulsive and in bad taste. He can keep wishing but I am grateful never to have shared screen space with someone as pathetic as him and I will make sure it never happens for the rest of my film career as well.

Not because he doesnâ€™t have the money, but because his mother handles his finances and doesnâ€™t allow him to splurge.
The actor, who will be next seen in Kabir Khanâ€™s Chandu Champion, doesnâ€™t know how much money he has in his account, and has no idea how to check his bank balance. He told Film Companion, â€œMy mother handles my money. I donâ€™t know how much money there is in my account or if there is any money or not.â€

But when the actor was questioned about how it feels being a regular topic of discussion on Koffee with Karan, Kartik replied, â€œEk cheez mujhe lagti hai â€“ relationship agar do logo ki hai toh dusre insaan ko bhi woh baatein nahi karni chahiye. Hum sab ko apni relationship ki respect karni chahiye (One thing I believe is that if a relationship is between two people, the other person should not talk about it. We should all respect our relationships).â€

"Actor Ankita Lokhande said that she still struggles to address late actor Sushant Singh Rajput in the past tense. The two actors, who were co-stars on the hit show Pavitra Rishta, dated for seven years before calling the relationship off.
In the latest episode of Bigg Boss, Ankita opened up about dealing with Sushantâ€™s death. The actor passed away in 2020. Ankita said Sushant was also her husband Vicky Jainâ€™s friend, and to remind oneself that he is no more is the â€œworst feeling.â€ Ankita and Vicky got married in 2021. Recalling the emotionally draining time, Ankita revealed that she could not get herself to attend Sushantâ€™s funeral as she knew she wouldnâ€™t be able to see him. â€œMein toh uske funeral pe bhi nahi gayi thi. Mei jaa hi nahi paayi. Muje laga mei nahi dekh sakti yeh. Mei yeh dekh hi nahi sakti (I did not even go to the funeral. I couldnâ€™t go. I thought I wouldnâ€™t be able to see him like that at all),â€ she added.

"Purported screenshots of an Instagram Story allegedly posted by Angelina Jolie and Brad Pittâ€™s son Pax have resurfaced online. In the Story, which was reportedly posted online in 2020 after Pitt won an Oscar for his performance in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Pax described his father as a â€˜world class a**holeâ€™ who makes his four youngest children â€˜tremble in fearâ€™.
â€œYou have made the lives of those closest to me a constant hell,â€ Pax wrote, adding that â€˜the truth will come to light some dayâ€™. Jolie and Pitt separated in 2016 after two years of marriage, but over a decade together after meeting on the sets of 2005â€™s Mr and Mrs Smith. They were subsequently involved in an acrimonious divorce that continues to play out partially before the public.

"Farrey (which means â€˜chitâ€™) is a refreshing change from the many typical high-school dramas, which are currently flooding streaming services, and often pack in-your-face violence, sex and substance abuse. The movie, an official adaptation of Thai writer-director Nattawut Poonpriyaâ€™s acclaimed â€˜Bad Geniusâ€™, instead throws the spotlight on its academically brilliant protagonist who is drawn into a web of manipulation and greed, before she picks up the art of hustling herself.
The movie introduces debutant Alizeh Agnihotri (Salman Khanâ€™s niece), who may not exude the flamboyance of her star uncle but confidently essays the role of an exceptionally bright teenager who finds herself in a bind. Agnihotri plays the role of the â€˜bad geniusâ€™ Niyati, who has been brought up in an orphanage by its warden and his wife. After becoming the state topper, Niyati ends up bagging a coveted scholarship that helps her secure a place at a prestigious international school. Her impressive score notwithstanding, Niyati is a misfit in the elite setup where students are driven around in luxury cars. But this genius is blessed with street-smartness and is quick to adapt to its ways.
What starts as an innocuous act of helping a classmate for Niyati, soon grows into a cheating racket during examinations. As more rich students get involved in it, the orphanage starts getting more donations and Niyati has money for her expenses. Soon, another bright but poor student Aakash, who had also bagged the scholarship, is drawn into this racket in spite of his initial resistance. The school-level cheating eventually spirals into an international-level fraud. What works in this ambitious plan-gone-horribly-awry kind of thriller is the taut storytelling that doesnâ€™t lose its focus even as it builds the tension.

"The ICC Menâ€™s Cricket World Cup final between India and Australia on Sunday, had many Bollywood celebrities cheering for the Men In Blue at Ahmedabadâ€™s Narendra Modi stadium. Actor Ranveer Singh, an ardent fan of sport, was in the stands along with his actor-wife Deepika Padukone, sister-in-law Anisha, and Shah Rukh Khan and family. A video of the actor has surfaced on the internet where he is seen passionately applauding Team India after the dismissal of Australian batsman David Warner.
In the video, as Warner walks out of the field, the camera pans to an enthusiastic Ranveer, who is shouting â€œCome onâ€. He then takes a sigh of relief and encourages the Indian supporters in the stands to cheer the loudest for their team. At some moments, he also seems to be intensely tense as it was a crucial game.
Shah Rukh and Gauri, who are standing beside Ranveer, look composed while applauding for Team India. Shah Rukhâ€™s elder son, Aryan Khan is also in a zen mode. Deepika, on the other hand, continues to look tense.

But despite an unfavourable end, the actor, who essayed the role of former cricketer Kapil Dev in 2021 film 83, applauded the Indian players for giving their all to the game.
Ranveer wrote on Instagram, â€œSome highs, some lows. Some good days, some bad days. Some wins, some losses. Thatâ€™s sport. Thatâ€™s life. We are all gutted, but letâ€™s applaud our boys for giving it their all.â€

"Salman Khanâ€˜s Tiger 3 registered its lowest single-day box office haul yet on day nine of release, as it collected Rs 6.5 crore all languages in India according to industry tracker Sacnilk. The action film has been sluggish at the box office despite a strong opening on Diwali. Overall, the filmâ€™s domestic collections stand at Rs 236 crore, with Rs 250 crore on the cards but Rs 300 crore almost certainly out of reach. By comparison, the the fourth film in YRFâ€™s Spy Universe, Pathaan, made more than Rs 500 crore domestically through the course of its theatrical run earlier this year.
Pathaan, starring Shah Rukh Khan, also made over Rs 1000 crore worldwide, a number that Tiger 3 will be lucky to gross half of. The film is inching towards the Rs 400 crore mark currently, with around Rs 380 crore in the bank. On day nine, Tiger 3 reported overall Hindi language occupancy of 13%, with revenue from Tamil and Telugu releases all but nil.

Not only does Salman not have a strong foothold in the overseas market, especially as compared to Shah Rukh, he is also struggling to capture attention in the South of India, despite repeated attempts to produce crossover hits with films such as Dabangg 3 and Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan. Produced on a reported budget of Rs 300 crore, Tiger 3 will likely be classified as an under-performer, especially in light of the high expectations and despite cameos from Shah Rukh and Hrithik Roshan.
There was no industry strike in India, but YRF still chose to follow the same marketing model that worked so well for Pathaan with Tiger 3, restricting its stars from talking about it to the press. But more than any other factor, what probably hurt the film was a general sense of indifference from both critics and audiences. The YRF Spy Universe will continue with War 2, which is currently in production, and a planned Tiger vs Pathaan movie after that. Tiger 3 is now the second-lowest grossing installment of the franchise, ahead of Ek Tha Tiger, but behind Tiger Zinda Hai, War and Pathaan.

"The National Commission for Women (NCW) has taken suo moto cognizance of  Tamil actor Mansoor Ali Khanâ€™s derogatory remarks about female actors, especially Trisha. At a press conference, Mansoor, who was part of Vijay-Trishaâ€™s Leo, said that there was no â€œbedroom scene with Trishaâ€ like he had with many female actors in his earlier films. His crass and misogynistic statement is facing severe backlash from many celebrities including Leoâ€™s director Lokesh Kanagaraj, who is admittedly a fan of Mansoorâ€™s acting. Now, National Commission for Women has taken suo moto cognizance of the matter.
An official tweet from NCW states that they have directed Deputy General of Police to invoke IPC Section 509 B and other relevant laws against Mansoor. The section is for sexual harassment by electronic mode. According to the section of Indian Penal Code, â€œWhoever, by means of telecommunication device or by any other electronic mode including internet, makes creates, solicits or initiates the transmission of any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image or other communication, which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy or indecent with intent to harass or cause or having knowledge that it would harass or cause annoyance or mental agony to a woman shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months but may extend to two years and shall also be liable to fine.â€"
"The worst way to approach a negative character is to play it like one, says actor Emraan Hashmi, who decided to portray his Tiger 3 character like an â€œanti-heroâ€.
Hashmi said he saw his character of Aatish Rehman, an ex-ISI agent, as someone whose ideology does not match with the viewpoint of the protagonist, played by Salman Khan in the film.
â€œYou have to tap into the darker side, but eventually the dynamics are the same. You have to be clear about the vision of the director. You bring in your own ideas for the characterâ€™s journey, the nuances and body language, and finally play him like the hero of his own narrative. Donâ€™t play it like a villain because thatâ€™s the worst way to approach the antagonist as then it becomes unidimensional,â€ Hashmi told PTI in an interview.

â€œMore than a villain, he is an anti-hero, his ideology is different from the viewpoint of the protagonist. He is the hero of his own narrative. So, I had to play it from that perspective and not make him into a typical villain,â€ he added.
Hashmi has played negative roles of varying shades in films such as Murder, Gangster, Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai and Chehre in the past.
For Tiger 3, he said the filmâ€™s team experimented with ten distinct looks. But they chose to not depict him as a stylish adversary.
â€œThis was not pre-decided that he is going to look this way, the salt-and-pepper hair. We felt he is not someone who cares about his look. He is not a manicured villain. I decided that he will be cool, sleek, (will wear) a Ray-Ban (glasses), leather jacket kind of guy, because he is also a spyâ€, he said.

Released on November 12, Tiger 3 has collected Rs 220.25 crore nett in India in seven days. The action thriller is directed by Maneesh Sharma and produced by Aditya Chopra under Yash Raj Films.
The film is a follow-up to Ek Tha Tiger (2012) and Tiger Zinda Hai (2017) and a part of YRFâ€™s ambitious spy universe that also includes Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s character from Pathaan and Hrithik Roshanâ€™s Kabir from War franchise. Tiger 3 sees Katrina Kaif returning as former ISI agent Zoya alongside Salman Khanâ€™s super spy, Avinash Singh Rathore.
Hashmi said it was enjoyable to share the screen space with Salman as they already knew each other. He said, â€œHe is very comfortable to be around with. Iâ€™m fond of him and he is fond of me, so it was easy and a joy working on the set with him. I was having fun, he was having fun with the action bit. We had a good action team and it was very interesting to see the kind of moves we had in the final fight.â€
Casting for Tiger 3 came as a surprise for Hashmi who thought the film would be something similar to what Sharma had directed in YRF when he was approached to meet the director. Sharma is known for movies such as Band Baaja Baarat, Ladies Vs Ricky Behl, Shuddh Desi Romance and Fan.

â€œHe said it is for the Tiger franchise. It (meeting) was during Covid-19, so I had my mask on, I removed my mask and he was like, â€˜You got a chocolate face but itâ€™s for the villain in the film!â€™. He was like, â€˜Emraan, if you donâ€™t mind, we want to do a testâ€™. I was like, â€˜Go for itâ€™. It is very important for a huge film to be clear if someone fits in visually for the character. Before I did the look test, he was like, â€˜You are seeing the character the way Iâ€™m seeing it, and Iâ€™m getting a good feeling about this. Letâ€™s do thisâ€™,â€ he said.
There was speculation that Hashmi had joined the project as the main antagonist but the makers decided to keep it a secret for a long time.
â€œI knew you all (media) knew but I was not allowed to speak about it, so I had to make a joke about it and say, â€˜Iâ€™m not part of itâ€™ and lie through my teeth. The reason behind this was that the large portion of the audience should have been kept in the dark,â€ he added.

"While social media is the place for fans to root for their favourite actors and promote their films, the war between fan clubs of different actors can often get toxic. In a recent conversation, acclaimed director Mani Ratnam addressed the fan wars between Thalapathy Vijay and Ajith Kumar on social media and called such debates on social media â€˜a random roadside argument.â€™
Mani Ratnam appeared at a round table discussion at Galatta Plus, along with directors like Vetrimaaran, Sudha Kongara, Mari Selvaraj, Madonne Ashwin, and PS Vinothraj. Speaking about fan club wars on social media, Mani shared, â€œSocial media has the privilege of anonymity so people are just spitting venom. It is only negativity that comes from there. Now, you told me that in Thirunelveli and Nagercoil people are not talking about the box office collection of the film but discussing if the film is good or not, now that you have told me. I am very happy about it.â€

"Screenwriter, lyricist and poet Javed Akhtarhas penned many iconic songs in his illustrious career. During his recent conversation, Javed was asked about his opinion on the current Hindi music industry and why most recent songs sound like a clone of each other. Defending the lyricists, Akhtar said that the writers have a lot of potential but their creativity is curbed by the marketing department.
In an interview with CNN News 18, he said, â€œI will not blame the songwriters at all. It is not that they are not talented, some of them are very talented, and they have great vocabulary at their disposal one can see that, they can do much better work than what they are doing. The problem is with the marketing department that controls the creativity and so the creativity suffers. Many things are not in favour of the writers. Most current generation directors have been bought up on Western and continental cinema, so they are a bit shy of lip-syncing songs and most of the songs are played in the background, and lip-syncing songs are the so-called item songs, which are not supposed to be taken seriously.â€

"Filmmaker Zoya Akhtar says the conversation around privilege is genuine and one that must be had, but are people looking at it with nuance? Not really, the director says as she gears up for her latest feature The Archies, which became the talking point on the internet since its first announcement for being the debut of three industry kids.
The Archies marks the acting debut of Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s daughter Suhana, megastar Amitabh Bachchanâ€™s grandson Agastya and actor Sridevi and film producer Boney Kapoorâ€™s daughter Khushi. Along with them, the upcoming Netflix feature will also see the debut of Mihir Ahuja, Dot., Vedang Raina and Yuvraj Menda.

When The Archies cast was first reported, a section on the internet reignited the conversation around nepotism in the film industry. In an interview with Indianexpress.com, Zoya said while the debate is important, it is slightly misplaced.
ADVERTISEMENT
â€œThere is definitely a conversation of have and have nots, there is definitely a conversation of people with privilege and those without. May be the film industry has become a symbol of it to some level, but I think what people need to ask for is what they really want. Better school, better education? By denying someone a career of their choice, thatâ€™s not going to make anything better for you. So I understand that to the root of it there is something but just this conversation is not taking it anywhere. It is not changing anything,â€ she said.
Daughter of writer Javed Akhtar and actor writer Honey Irani, Zoya said her parents came to the industry with nothing and built their career. As their daughter, Zoya said, she inherited their skills and contacts and yet it took her close to a decade to make her first film. the filmmaker said if she wasnâ€™t good at her job, she wouldnâ€™t have had people put faithâ€“and moneyâ€“on her.
Also Read | Kriti Sanon on how Bollywood can become inclusive for â€˜more talentedâ€™ outsiders: â€˜If youâ€™re launching someone from the industryâ€¦â€™
â€œWhen my parents came to the film industry, my father came with nothing. He made his life here from nothing. I have inherited his love for writing and films and his contacts. Now what I should I do? Not continue to do what I want or not follow what I have learnt through osmosis. I love the movies and why will I not follow that?
â€œYou canâ€™t rig the game. If I was making films that nobody watched, I would not have this job. It is a fair game. There is truth to the privilege conversationâ€“ but thatâ€™s a separate debate, this (blaming film industry) is not going to help that,â€ she added.
ADVERTISEMENT
Filmmaker Reema Kagti, who has produced The Archies with Zoya through their production house Tiger Baby, said the â€œnepotismâ€ debate in the context of The Archies has no merit. â€œIn this context I feel it doesnâ€™t hold at all. There are seven people in the film, but people are only talking about the three. Some people donâ€™t even know their first names!â€
Also Read | Amitabh Bachchan cheers for grandson Agastya Nandaâ€™s The Archies: â€˜You carry the torch ably aheadâ€™
Zoya said it is painful how the other young actors arenâ€™t getting their due as of yet, but that is not done by design by them or Netflix. The director, giving an example of how nepotism needs to be looked at with more nuance, said Reema, an outsider, got to make her first film even before she did, despite being an industry kid.
â€œIt is really sad because there are four other kids being launched and they were robbed off that moment. I feel bad for them, they were equally excited, even their parents. Thatâ€™s not fair. Thatâ€™s not something that we or Netflix did. You are talking to me about nepotism, I am born and bred here and it took me seven years to make my first movie. Reema (an outsider) came and made her first film before me! It is not so black and white. I wish people were more nuanced about it and see it for wat it really is,â€ she added.
The Indian adaptation of the beloved classic is seen through the lens of the Anglo-Indian community as the group of teenagers wrestle with love, heartache, friendship and rebellion. The Archies trailer offers a glimpse into the world of the film, set in the fictional hilly town of Riverdale, in the â€™60s India.

The Archies is directed by Zoya, who has co-written it with Reema and Ayesha Devitre. The film will stream on Netflix from December 7.

"In its almost 70-decade history, Hindi cinema has seen female leads transform from â€˜dukhiyaariâ€™ and â€˜bechaariâ€™ to ones who live on their own terms. Not just the roles they play, but even their look has evolved. And, the one actress who has enabled actresses of today to showcase their sultry side unabashedly and wear whatever they choose is Zeenat Aman. It is Zeenat who broke the template of â€˜traditional is beautifulâ€™, followed staunchly by her predecessors, and made way for the likes of Kareena Kapoor Khan, Priyanka Chopra, Aishwarya Rai and Alia Bhatt, among others, to look stylish, wear modern clothes and embrace their sensuality on-screen.
Zeenat Aman entered the film industry in 1971 and burst the idealistic bubble of the 1950s and 1960s, paving way for a more realistic portrayal of women, who until then were divided into either vamps or sati-savitri. In fact, the first time people took notice of her was when she was smoking marijuana, wearing bohemian prints and bindis, and living like a hippie in Hare Rama Hare Krishna. She played Janice, Dev Anandâ€™s young sister who consumed drugs, a role rejected by many lead actresses of the time.

In a recent interview, Sushmita recalled her â€œshowdownâ€ with Mahesh on the first day of filming.

There was no acting coach. I was just made to look good and brought for the muhurat shot,â€ she recalled.

"Sushmita Sen created history when she became the first Indian to win the Miss Universe pageant back in 1994. While Sushmita has always spoken about how supportive her family was, in a recent interview, she opened up about how her father did not speak to her when he learnt that she would be participating in Miss India. Even when she had to wear a swimsuit for one of the rounds in the pageant, her father was quite upset about it.
Talking to Mid-Day, Sushmita said that she was all of 18 when her life changed, and at that point, her father wanted her to be an IAS officer. â€œMy father wanted me to be an IAS officer, so I was studying accordingly. When the bomb was dropped on my father that she is going to Miss India, my father didnâ€™t speak to me for a bit,â€ she said.

"One of the most beloved celebrity couples, pop singer Joe Jonas and actor Sophie Turner shocked their fans with news of their separation. Despite the joint statement expressing an â€˜amicableâ€™ decision to part ways, tensions escalated when they entered a bitter custody battle for their daughters, Delphine and Willa.
However, a later development revealed that the two reached a â€œtemporary custody agreementâ€ for the remainder of 2023."

Recently, Javed opened up about the creation of the iconic title track and expressed gratitude to Karan Johar. The song was composed by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy and sung by Sonu Nigam.
In an interview with Showsha, he recalled the creative journey, highlighting the songâ€™s pivotal role in the filmâ€™s narrative. He explained that the song served as the backbone of the script, threading through different situations and dramatic moments. He said, â€œThat song was kind of a spine of the script, and obviously, it was given that dignity within the script.â€

"Sushmita Sen has been very vocal about her personal life in the many decades that she has been in the public eye, which is why her fans were quite shocked when she chose to stay mum about her rumoured relationship with entrepreneur Lalit Modi. Modi had shared a social media post in July 2022 implying that the two were in a romantic relationship, and had even called her his â€œbetter half.â€ She did not make any statement about their relationship. In a recent interview, Sushmita was asked about the same incident (though Lalit Modiâ€™s name was beeped out by Mid-Day), and she said that she was â€œlaughingâ€ through this chapter.
When asked if she was going to marry him, she told Mid-Day, â€œI just put out one post on Instagram because sometimes I think when people keep quiet, their silence is mistaken for weakness or fear. I just wanted to put out one post to let them know that Iâ€™m laughing. After that, I was done with it.â€

Lalit Modi had put on social media that they were â€œjust dating each otherâ€ and â€œnot marriedâ€ but he added that marriage â€œwill happen one day.â€ When asked about her plans of marrying him, she said in the interview, â€œIf I was gong to marry someone, I would be married to them.

"Katrina Kaif and Salman Khan-starrer Tiger 3 was released in theatres on November 12. Katrina discussed how Tiger is probably the only trilogy in Indian cinema where all three films have been directed by three different filmmakers. The actor, who plays the elite former spy Zoya in the series, discussed the distinct visions of Kabir Khan, Ali Abbas Zafar, and Maneesh Sharma and provided a breakdown of each directorâ€™s contribution to the series.
Kabir Khan, who directed the first film Ek Tha Tiger, was praised by Katrina for his collaborative and amiable nature. According to Katrina, Khan had a forward-thinking view that laid the foundation for the series. In an interview with Pinkvilla, Katrina said, â€œHeâ€™s an incredibly collaborative director, amiable, always open to your ideas and suggestions. You always feel heâ€™s hearing you completely. Heâ€™s not just nodding his head; heâ€™s really listening to you. Thatâ€™s one of the most wonderful things about Kabir.â€

"Actor Ranbir Kapoor will soon be seen shaking a leg with Telugu superstar Nandamuri Balakrishna on the show Unstoppable with NBK 2, as he promotes his upcoming film Animal. Ranbir will be accompanied by his co-star Rashmika Mandanna and their director Sandeep Reddy Vanga.

The promo also gives a glimpse of several other interesting moments. Sandeep is shown the posters of Animal and his first film Arjun Reddy, featuring actor Vijay Deverakonda. Ranbir then tells Balakrishna to ask Rashmika who is her favourite actor between him and Vijay. Another scene shows Rashmika calling someone and blushing as the voice from the other side says â€œWhatsup reâ€™. Fans speculated in the comments that it is Vijay, who is rumoured to be dating Rashmika.

"Bollywood actor Katrina Kaif, who can currently be seen in Tiger 3 opposite Salman Khan, has opened up about the famous hammam scene and the challenges she faced while shooting it. The actor credited the conceptualisation of the fight to YRF head honcho Aditya Chopra, and added that she gets into a â€˜different zoneâ€™ with films like Tiger 3. In the scene, Katrina, as Zoya, fought hand-to-hand with Hollywood stuntwoman and actor Michelle Leeâ€™s character in a steamy hammam, wearing only towels.
In an interview with Bollywood Hungama, Katrina said that action films can be â€˜toughâ€™, and added that preparation is the key. The actor said that she has to get into  â€˜a different zoneâ€™. She said, â€œWhen itâ€™s Tiger time, that mode goes on. Thatâ€™s a different mode. I was actually talking about it yesterday with Vicky, and he was explaining to someone that â€˜when Tiger comes, itâ€™s a different mode and  I see a different person.â€™â€

"One of the worldâ€™s worst industrial disasters took place in Bhopal, which turned into a gas chamber when forty tonnes of methyl- isocyanate leaked from the Union Carbide factory on the night of December 2, 1984. Three thousand eight hundred (figures from the National Centre of Biotechnology Information) people died immediately that night, most of whom lived in the â€˜bastiâ€™ closest to the factory: this was the official figure; unofficially, the figure was several times higher.
By the next morning, streets were littered with corpses of humans and animals, and hospitals were overflowing with those suffering from burning eyes and constricted chests.

"A proud mother of two daughters, Sushmita Sen surprised many with her decision to step back from the film industry and prioritise her family. This choice, made at the height of her professional success, raised eyebrows among those who expected her to continue at full throttle. Recalling the period when she adopted her second daughter, Alisah, in 2010 when she was just one month old, Sushmita recently shared that her decision to take a break was driven by a desire to avoid being separated from her kids. However, she stated that the hiatus extended beyond her initial expectations and she found herself as a single mom with bills to pay but sans a job.
â€œI canâ€™t leave her with her nanny and be doing something I donâ€™t like. Of course, I did have my then-manager and people from the industry, friends, who dubbed my decision as hara-kiri and said that I was making a very big blunder,â€ she said during an interview with Mid-Day.

â€œThey said this is the prime of my age and advised me not to quit. However, I wasnâ€™t quitting; I was just taking a break. But, who takes a break? Itâ€™s a very male-driven industry, so, as a woman, you have only so much time to look your best. I told them they were probably right, but inside me, there was a voice asking me not to do it. I have to listen to that voice because it has worked for me my whole life,â€ she added.

  A post shared by RenÃ©e Sen (@reneesen47)
Sushmita stated that the break continued for a longer period than she expected. â€œThe scripts that were coming, they also dried up, obviously because I wasnâ€™t visible.â€ At this point, she was a single mom with bills to pay but no job as an actor. Sushmita recalled that her association with Renee Jewellers and the endorsements she had helped her move forward. â€œWe had branches of Renee Jewellers all over the Middle East. So, we were looking into that, and I was also doing some endorsements.â€

Between 2010 and 2012, she also ran the Miss Universe franchise from India, at a time when it was owned by former US President Donald Trump.

Expressing that Alisah herself served as the inspiration for her return to work, Sushmita recounted an incident from 2012 when her daughter provided her with a candid career evaluation. â€œShe was eight, and one day she saw some paps under our house and asked me why they were taking pictures of me. I told her itâ€™s because I am famous, to which she asked, â€˜doing what?â€™ When I told her I was Miss Universe, she reminded me that it was a long time ago. Then, when I told her I am an actor too, she responded by saying that I donâ€™t act anymore. I said thatâ€™s because I wanted to be with herâ€¦â€
â€œBut then I realised that the time had come. She was kind of telling me off and trying to encourage me to break free from my inertia, go back to what I am supposed to do.â€
ICYMI | Sushmita Sen says Donald Trump was never her â€˜bossâ€™ on Miss Universe, working with him wasnâ€™t â€˜easy or funâ€™
Reflecting on reaching out to the heads of Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar et al, Sushmita emphasised the unforgettable nature of the experience. â€œI was jobless. I had no experience in the last eight years. The world had changed dramatically, and OTT had shown up. I was loving the content on OTT. I personally made the calls because I wanted them to know I was hungry.â€
Acknowledging that her children arenâ€™t particularly fond of her movies, Sushmita described them as her grounding factor. â€œThey are the biggest critics of every little thing. They are very proud of the person I am, but they are not always very proud of the work I do, which is absolutely fair.â€

"After having a thunderous opening on Sunday, November 12, Salman Khan and Katrina Kaifâ€˜s Tiger 3 has been seeing a downward trend in its earnings over the last few days. According to the early estimates of tracking website Sacnilk, director Maneesh Sharmaâ€™s film eared Rs 13 crore at the box office on Friday, taking its domestic gross total to Rs 200 crore. Tiger 3 is third instalment in the series, after Kabir Khanâ€™s Ek Tha Tiger (2012) and Ali Abbas Zaffarâ€™s  Tiger Zinda Hai(2017). It is also the fifth entry in the larger YRF Spy Universe.
Tiger 3â€™s worldwide gross collection stands at Rs 325 crore, within a week of release. The action-thriller opened in theatres on Sunday, on the occasion of Diwali, and continued to do well until the Bhai Dooj holiday on Wednesday. However, Team Indiaâ€™s success at the ongoing Cricket World Cup tournament could have impacted the filmâ€™s performance. India will compete in the final on Sunday, which theoretically could be a big day for Tiger 3.

"Unlike the secret competition among heroes, there ainâ€™t an evident battle among female actors for the title of â€˜Lady Superstarâ€™. It is fair to say that seldom do heroines get a chance to, for lack of a better word, perform in films. And even when they do, mostly the performances that involve a lot of crying and, at times, wailing get deemed as the best. Or in the old times, playing a â€˜boldâ€™ character like Sripriyaâ€™s Manju in Aval Apadithaan (1978), Lakshmiâ€™s Ganga in Sila Nerangalil Sila Manitharagal (1977), or Sarithaâ€™s Sevanthi in Thaneer Thaneer (1981) gets invariably deemed as best performance. A female actor either has to be in a sob story or in a provocative film. Priyamaniâ€™s Muthazhagu in Paruthiveeran is a relatively modern example. Letâ€™s not digress into the topic of why even the monickers given to female actors are just female versions of the male actorsâ€™. Sometimes it gets worse like calling Saritha or Radhika Sarathkumar the Lady Sivaji. Thatâ€™s a whole different topic. Letâ€™s just assume such titles, despite their innate sexism, mean particular heroines are not just much-wanted actors but also artistes who can â€˜performâ€™. And on top of that, she can do big-budget â€˜female-centric filmsâ€™. Nayanthara is all that. However, she is unique than all the aforementioned female actors because she got there by doing roles that didnâ€™t involve wailing a lot, nor was it the quintessential â€˜Bharathi Kanda Pudhumai Penâ€™ (Poet Bharathiâ€™s idea of a modern woman). She did something as unique as Kadambari in Naanum Rowdy Dhaan. It is fair to say the film changed the career of Nayanthara. It is because we finally got to see that the star can be much more than Tamil cinemaâ€™s Lora Croft.
Not just Nayantharaâ€™s role, director Vignesh Shivanâ€™s film itself was a bit eccentric and unique. Naanum Rowdy Dhaan (I am a rowdy too) is about a cowardly youngsterâ€™s desperation to become a rowdy as he thinks thatâ€™s cooler than being a cop like his mom. The title is borrowed from Vadiveluâ€™s comedy segment from Thalai Nagaram (2006), where the ace comedian plays a pretend gangster. But Naanum Rowdy Dhaan is more about the heroine Kadambari than its hero Pandian (Vijay Sethupathi). In a sense, Naanum Rowdy Thaan is a converse of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl trope. Here, itâ€™s the guy who exists just to help the brooding/grieving girl. As far as the plot goes, Kadambari is on a mission to kill a dreaded gangster Killivalavan (Parthiban), the man responsible for the death of both her father and mother. She has also lost her hearing because of the don, who is now a politician. When Pandian falls for Kadambari, she wants him to team up with her in the revenge saga. Thus begins the journey of the couple to hunt down the demon. Undoubtedly, without the effective performance of Nayanthara, the film would have lost its impact as she has to be this emotional quirk in the movie, which is otherwise in a perennial jolly mood.

"Sean â€œDiddyâ€ Combs, was accused in a lawsuit Thursday of subjecting R&B singer Cassie to a yearslong relationship that included beatings and rape.
Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, alleged in the suit filed against the producer and music mogul in New York federal court that Combs brought her into his â€œostentatious, fast-paced, and drug-fueled lifestyleâ€ not long after she met him and signed to his label when she was 19 and he was 37 in 2005.
Attorney Ben Brafman said Combs â€œvehemently deniesâ€ the allegations.
Ventura, now 37 herself, said Combs, now 54, began the pattern of abuse as soon as their relationship did.
ADVERTISEMENT
The suit alleges that, â€œprone to uncontrollable rage,â€ he subjected her to â€œsavageâ€ beatings in which he punched, kicked and stomped her. It alleges he plied her with drugs, and forced her to have sex with other men while he masturbated and filmed them.
The suit says that as she was trying to end the relationship in 2018, Combs forced her into her Los Angeles home and raped her.
â€œAfter years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships,â€ Ventura said in a statement.
The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly as Ventura has.
Brafman called the allegations â€œliesâ€.

â€œFor the past six months, Mr. Combs has been subjected to Ms. Venturaâ€™s persistent demand of $30 million, under the threat of writing a damaging book about their relationship, which was unequivocally rejected as blatant blackmail,â€ he said in a statement. â€œDespite withdrawing her initial threat, Ms. Ventura has now resorted to filing a lawsuit riddled with baseless and outrageous lies, aiming to tarnish Mr. Combsâ€™s reputation and seeking a payday.â€
Venturaâ€™s lawyer Douglas Wigdor responded in a statement that Combs offered her â€œeight figures to silence her and prevent her the filing of this lawsuit. She rejected his efforts and decided to give a voice to all woman who suffer in silence.â€
Combs is among the most influential hip-hop producers and executives of the past three decades. He and Ventura began dating in 2007 and had an on-and-off relationship for more than a decade.
She became known for the Ryan Leslie-produced hit single â€œMe & U,â€ which secured the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop songs chart in 2006. The song was the lead single of her only studio album, which was self-titled.

As an actor, she has appeared in several television and films projects including Foxâ€™s Empire, Step Up 2:The Streets and Spenser Confidential.
Combs built one of hip-hopâ€™s biggest empires, blazing a trail with several entities attached to his famous name. He is the founder of Bad Boy Records and a three-time Grammy winner who has worked with a slew of top-tier artists including Notorious B.I.G., Mary J. Blige, Usher, Lil Kim, Faith Evans and 112.
The mogul created the fashion clothing line Sean John, launched the Revolt TV channel with a focus on music, and produced the reality show Making the Band for MTV.
This year, he released his fifth studio album The Love Album: Off the Grid, which earned two Grammy nominations this month.

The lawsuit cites a speech Combs gave while receiving a lifetime achievement honor at the BET Awards in 2022, in which he thanked Ventura for â€œholding me down in the dark times, loveâ€.
The suit says, â€œThe truth, however, is that Cassie â€” Ms. Casandra Ventura â€” was held down by Mr. Combs and endured over a decade of his violent behavior and disturbed demands.â€"

"Screenwriter-lyricist Manoj Muntashir Shukla recently opened up about his admiration for Javed Akhtar. Muntashir also revealed how he has not been able to accept rap songs and compared how people criticise his dialogues and the rap songs with â€˜ghanta and nangaâ€™ words win awards.
In an interview with The Lallantop, the writer was asked about Akhtar. He said, â€œIf I continue working for the next 20-25 years, perhaps Iâ€™ll reach a point where people mention my name alongside Javed Akhtarâ€™s in one breath. Right now, I donâ€™t consider myself worthy. If I were to take the names of some people in this world whom I deeply respect, then Javed Saab is in my top two or three, irrespective of everything.â€

"Veteran filmmaker Ridley Scott likens working with Oscar-winner Joaquin Phoenix to â€œa toboggan rideâ€. The Gladiator director and star reunited after more than two decades to make the upcoming Napoleon Bonaparte biopic Napoleon, which premiered in London on Thursday.
â€œIt was exactly the same,â€ Scott said of working with Phoenix, jokingly adding â€œI like stress,â€ when asked what he liked about his leading man.
The film portrays Napoleon, a historical figure both revered and criticised in France, as a ruthless military tactician whose softer, vulnerable side was uncovered by his wife Josephine, played by British actress Vanessa Kirby.

In addition to collaborating with Phoenix, Ridley Scott said he also wanted to return to a theme he first explored in his feature film debut in 1977.
â€œIn The Duellists I end on Napoleon Bonaparte. Thatâ€™s the reason why. I enjoy that part of France and the whole ambience of that culture. So, I wanted to go back to it completely with Napoleon,â€ he told Reuters on the red carpet.
The director, 85, whose long career includes hit films such as Thelma & Louise, Alien and The Martian, said his production team was dedicated to making the historical epic look accurate.
â€œEvery aspect of what you see from armoury to horses to saddles to hats, to the wardrobe, itâ€™s all researched. I sit there like an octopus glomming all this stuff coming at me because theyâ€™ve researched everyone.

â€œIâ€™m like a child, I look at picture books. I go â€˜I like thatâ€™. So, I donâ€™t do anything.â€
Filmed during the pandemic, Ridley Scott and his frequent collaborator for cinematography, Dariusz Wolski, orchestrated elaborate battle scenes, that recounted Napoleonâ€™s conquests in Austerlitz and Moscow, and his famous defeat in Waterloo.
â€œSince the beginning of the pandemic Iâ€™ve made The Last Duel, Gucci, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Iâ€™m halfway through Gladiator (2). We donâ€™t stop. We ran that protecting it like an army. I had no COVID problems at all,â€ Scott said.
Napoleon is out in cinemas on November 24.

"Months after the release of the Prabhas and Kriti Sanon-starrer Adipurush, the filmâ€™s dialogue writer, Manoj Muntashir Shukla, has acknowledged that the movie was â€˜wrongâ€™. He went on to explain that the intentions behind the film were good, but there were mistakes made in the process.
In an interview with The Lallantop, Muntashir said, â€œAdipurush is a film which was made with good intentions, but it was wrong, and by accepting this, I will not become small.â€ When asked why the film was â€˜wrongâ€™, he said, â€œEvery film has a narrative, which we think about, before making a film.

"Actor Emraan Hashmiâ€™s turn as the menacing villain Aatish in Tiger 3 has been lauded by the audience and critics. However, some viewers felt that his character had a similar backstory to that of John Abrahamâ€™s character Jim in Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s Pathaan. Emraan said that while the trigger for both the characters could be the same, the way Aatish was presented was different.
In an interview with Zoom, when asked about similarities with Jim from Pathaan, Emraan said, â€œI didnâ€™t really know about his (Jim) journey in the film. I came to know when I saw it, but I think the way Maneesh (Sharma) has presented it and the way it was written, it might have been the same trigger.â€
