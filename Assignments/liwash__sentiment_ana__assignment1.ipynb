            "resist communication either because they are feeling bothered or because they know that lies are involved.\n",
            "This leads to communication producing the opposite or undesired effect. This study highlights the fact\n",
            "that despite all the beautiful functions of mass media, the presentation of some information in some ways,\n",

            "2. Rural forms of communication should not be neglected in the rural development process. Even\n",
            "though most rural dwellers prefer radio, it may be for the additional reason of prestige. They\n",
            "want to be modern. Despite this, a reasonable proportion of them still want traditional means of\n",
            "information. After all, to carry out a road project, for instance, rural dwellers do not go to\n",
            "announce it on radio. Therefore, message designers need to incorporate many traditional forms of\n",
            "communication in their multi-media rural development strategy.\n",
            "3. The choice of rural development projects should be that of the rural dweller. Development\n",
            "agencies and governments should no longer allocate projects to rural areas without the people\n",
            "saying that it is what they want.\n",
