**Criteria/Guidelines for Final Text Mining Project/Assignment**

---

**1. Corpus Selection:**  
- Use **any corpus relevant to your areas of research**.
- Do not forget corpus building criteria while curating your data.

---

**2. Project Structure:**

The project should follow a clear and organized structure, including the following sections:

- **Introduction, review of literature, research question, objectives, methodology, analysis,  limitation, challenges, future work and conclusion (you have to include-- what the audience can take away from the outcome of the text mining process)**  
- **Word limit**: 3000 to 4000 words
- **Reference style**: APA (both in-text citation and bibliography)
  
- **a. Research Questions:**
Formulate specific, innovative questions that your sentiment analysis aims to address.

- **b. Objectives:**  
  Clearly define what you aim to achieve through this project.
  
- **c. Methodology:**  
  - Your methodology can include **more than one method** from the methods we studied in the class. 
  - You can also include the gold standard method, the combination of qualitative and quantitative methods.
  - Do not use **Sentiment Analysis**.
  
  **Justification:** 
- Provide a **rationale** for choosing these methods. Explain how each contributes to answering your research questions.

---

**3. Visualization of the Output:**  
- Include visual elements like **bar charts**, **word clouds**, **pie charts**, or **heatmaps** to represent your findings.
- Visualizations should clearly communicate your results and make it easier to interpret the data.

---

**4. Interpretation of Results:**  
- Provide a **convincing and thorough interpretation** of your outputs and also provide in-text citations wherever it is needed.
- Link your findings back to your **research questions** and **objectives**.
- Discuss any **unexpected results** or **patterns** you observed.

---

**5. Mode of Submission:**  
- Submit your project as a **Project Report** as a pdf or word file and code can be shared using either **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.
- Use **Markdown/Text Mode** within these environments to write the structured parts of your assignment (Research Questions, Objectives, Methodology, etc.).

---

**Rubrics:**  
Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Project Structure:**  
   - Clarity and organization of your introduction, review of literature, research question, objectives, methodology, analysis,  limitation, challenges, future work and conclusion (you have to include-- what the audience can take away from the outcome of the text mining process)

2. **Innovative Research Questions and Methods:**  
   - Originality and creativity in framing your research questions and selecting methods.

3. **Visualization:**  
   - Use of effective and meaningful visualizations to represent your findings.

4. **Interpretation:**  
   - Depth and insight in interpreting the outputs. The ability to connect results to broader research questions.

5. **AI Help:**
   - Be transparent about how much help you received from AI: include the details of the help such as: curating your dataset and/or code
   - Rate yourself up to 10. Ex. 5 out of ten you relied on AI for code
     Explain each code that AI provided using MarkDown

All the best!
