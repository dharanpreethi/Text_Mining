**Criteria/Guidelines for Sentiment Analysis Assignment**

---

**1. Corpus Selection:**  
- Use the **review corpus** you curated for your **Corpus Linguistics assignment**.
- If you do not have the review corpus, you can use **any corpus relevant to your research area**.

**2. Project Structure:**

The project should follow a clear and organized structure, including the following sections:

- **a. Research Question(s):**  
  Formulate specific, innovative questions that your sentiment analysis aims to address.

- **b. Objectives:**  
  Clearly define what you aim to achieve through this project.
  
- **c. Methodology:**  
  Your methodology should include **more than one method**. For example:
  - **KWIC (Key Word in Context)** analysis.
  - **Frequent Word Analysis**.
  - **Sentiment Analysis**.
  
  **Justification:** Provide a **rationale** for choosing these methods. Explain how each contributes to answering your research questions.
