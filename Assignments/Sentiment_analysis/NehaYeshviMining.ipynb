      "AI promises to reshape not only how students learn but also how they engage with subjects, how educators teach, and how institutions adapt to this fast-paced revolution. However, as with any major shift, the incorporation of AI into higher education has not been a uniform process. Ashwin Mishra Parth Sharma Tuesday January 07, 2025 , 5 min Read FOLLOW US In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly moved from a futuristic concept to a tangible presence in nearly every facet of our lives. One of the most significant areas where AI has started to take hold is in higher education.  The transformative potential of AI promises to reshape not only how students learn but also how they engage with subjects, how educators teach, and how institutions adapt to this fast-paced revolution. However, as with any major shift, the incorporation of AI into higher education has not been a uniform process. Some disciplines have readily embraced AI tools, while others remain more sceptical, quite often for good reason.  The science and technology domains, naturally, have been at the forefront of AI integration. The intervals in the incidence of disruption that affect these fields has been steadily decreasing with time. It is for this reason that practitioners and scholars in this space appear more ready and open to adapting to their new AI-driven reality.   In contrast, disciplines such as humanities, law, and social sciences have been slower to adopt AI. This hesitance can be attributed to AI’s limitations in capturing the depth, nuance, and critical thinking essential to these fields.  These current limitations of AI in replicating human creativity, emotion, or cultural understanding may not exist in the not-so-distant future, if we are to go by the rate at which AI is evolving. But, even in its present nascent state, it still offers valuable tools that can enhance research, learning, and pedagogy.  For instance, AI-powered tools can help scholars in the humanities process vast amounts of text, uncover patterns in historical data, or even create dynamic, interactive learning experiences. Despite these benefits, the integration of AI is sometimes seen as a threat to the core of these disciplines. Different approaches to AI Most educational institutions are still grappling with the appropriate response to this game-changing technology. Some have resorted to an outright ban on the use of AI, some have espoused its unfettered use, and others have sought to identify a middle ground.  Regardless of the approach, no solution seems to have been without its fair share of challenges. The ban approach seems protectionist in nature, with the apparent fear and apprehension over the future of education causing its proponents to seek solace in the comfortable and the familiar, even if it is coming at the cost of operating under a metaphorical veil of ignorance.  The unfettered use approach appears to be operating out of a place of a different sort of ignorance, one that has a blind faith in the positive outlook of emerging technologies. The absence of sufficient guardrails for ensuring security, safety and integrity is overlooked as an issue of significance. Also Read From Valuations To Value: Edtech’s Shift Towards Sustainable Growth The middle ground approach between these two extremes is one that we as a society are currently oscillating between. The attempts at finding a balance are continuously ongoing, but are proving to be a complicated challenge. The regulatory framework for AI is unable to keep pace with the rate at which it is evolving. In academia, the disparity across fields in terms of their openness to AI and the general apprehension of its implications for the future of education have also been impediments to the identification of a universal solution to the AI question. That being said, a strategy of oblivion is unlikely to aid in addressing the problem. Recognising that AI is here to stay and that it needs to blend in and not shunned out of the education sphere is a crucial first step in this process. All the stakeholders in the educational journey—from students, to teachers and administrators—stand to gain from the use of AI.  AI’s potential  One of the most exciting possibilities for AI in higher education is its potential to complement and enhance traditional teaching methods. Rather than replace the human element of teaching, AI can support educators in personalising learning experiences, facilitating collaborative work, and providing students with immediate feedback. For example, AI-driven platforms can adapt to individual student needs, offering tailored learning resources that match their pace and style of learning. Furthermore, AI can help educators assess student progress in real time, allowing for more timely interventions and support. By automating routine tasks like grading or providing students with immediate feedback on assignments, AI can free up educators to focus on more creative and interactive aspects of teaching.  This means that classroom time can be used for deeper discussions, collaborative projects, and hands-on learning experiences, rather than being spent on administrative tasks. Incorporating AI into teaching is not about abandoning traditional methods; it’s about using technology to enhance them. AI tools can help students better grasp complex concepts, while also encouraging independent learning and critical thinking.  In this way, AI can be integrated into the educational landscape in a way that respects and supports the human-centered nature of teaching and learning.\n",

      "humans associate with the human mind, such as learning and problem-solving” (Russell & Norvig, 2009, p. 2).\n",

      "changing environments and changing goals, it learns from experience, and it makes appropriate choices given\n",
      "perceptual limitations and finite computation.”\n",
      "Although AI is not a new term, the meaning of modern AI has changed compared to conventional AI techniques.\n",
      "(Chen et al., 2020b). Recently, modern AI has tended to refer to the Deep Neural Networks (DNN) based\n",
      "techniques developed in recent years (Yosinski et al., 2014). DNN-based AI and analytic techniques have led to\n",
      "a significant evolution in both academic and industrial fields. With the rapid development of modern AI and\n",

However, careful implementation and regulation are needed to address challenges like equity, data security, and ethical concerns. A balanced approach can ensure that AI serves as a valuable tool to enhance education rather than replace essential human elements.\n",
      "Through the introduction of cutting-edge tools that improve administration, instruction, and learning, artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing education. Personalized learning, where AI-powered systems adjust to each student's needs by evaluating their progress, strengths, and shortcomings, is one important influence. With the help of these systems, which offer personalized learning resources and immediate feedback, students may study at their own speed and focus on their areas of weakness. Every student obtains a customized educational experience thanks to platforms like virtual tutors and adaptive learning tools, which promote greater comprehension and engagement. Additionally, AI-powered gamified learning elements increase motivation and retention by making learning more engaging and participatory.\n",
      "Teachers can concentrate on encouraging creativity and critical thinking in the classroom by using AI to automate repetitive work like grading, creating lesson plans, and handling administrative responsibilities. While virtual teaching assistants aid students with questions, offer more clarifications, and suggest resources, artificial intelligence (AI) systems such as Gradescope simplify the grading process. Additionally, by providing tools like real-time translation, text-to-speech for students with visual impairments, and speech-to-text for those with hearing impairments, AI enhances accessibility in education and guarantees inclusivity for a variety of student demographics. Additionally, AI offers data-driven insights that let teachers monitor student progress, forecast results, and improve curricula to improve learning outcomes.\n",
      "AI in education has drawbacks that need to be addressed despite its many advantages. Ensuring fair access to AI tools for underfunded schools and underprivileged groups is crucial, as are worries about data privacy and the moral use of student information. In order to fully utilize AI-driven solutions, educators must also adjust to these technological developments, which call for training and upskilling. When used properly, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to completely transform education by making it more efficient, inclusive, and personalized while also preparing institutions and students for the demands of the future.\n",

      "I want you to think about something. If you take a knife and cut some vegetables as you are preparing to dish up a good meal. Now the knife was used in a good way, it was just used for cooking purposes. On the other hand, that same knife can very well be used for murder and crime. It can even be a tool used for destruction or vandalism. Now the knife itself is still the same, but how we use it and what we use it for has changed. Let’s bring this analogy to AI. Let’s start with ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems) on the roads. If people become dependent on ADAS then that’s detrimental to the driving habits of the person, because now they cannot drive safely and comfortably without the system. On the other hand if they don’t depend on it but one day they so happen to be driving and lose focus for whatever reason and the car in front of them brakes, the system could send a blaring alarm or even brake for you. In this way it saves your life and car and is beneficial. Now let’s do an even more common AI system ChatGPT. If ChatGPT solves all your chemistry problems you just copy it and don’t retain anything maybe even just copy the answer, then it will hurt your learning in the long run. However if you use it to figure out a concept in general or the process for a problem especially if you have already struggled hard with the problem and couldn’t figure it out, then it may boost your learning since it’s helping with the process. Lately I’ve started incorporating artificial intelligence into my life more because I know this is the future and I want to be sure I can use these tools to my well-being and not to my utter dilapidation. If you held the patience to read all of this then thank you!\n",

      "“If there’s one thing India has never lacked, it’s a hunger for learning. Education isn’t just a personal pursuit here; it’s a cultural aspiration, a family’s collective dream often built on generations of toil and sacrifice.”\n",
      "Picture this: a rural teacher in Bihar juggling 50 students in a single classroom, trying to teach science with a textbook that hasn’t been updated in a decade. Now, imagine that same teacher equipped with an AI tool that suggests updated content tailored to age, evaluates each student’s understanding in real time, and provides actionable feedback. This isn’t sci-fi; it’s the future AI promises—a way to bring quality education to even the most remote and understaffed corners of India. \n",
      "Home to the world’s largest youth population, India is grappling with a mismatch between academic output and industry requirements, outdated curricula, teacher shortages, and deficiencies in soft skills. EdTech unicorns like BYJU’S and Unacademy have dominated conversations around digital learning, offering expansive reach and convenience. Yet, their models have faced criticism for being overly standardized, catering primarily to urban students, and focusing heavily on test preparation at the expense of personalized learning.\n",
      "Additionally, more than one of these giants has been under scrutiny for financial irregularities and violating the Companies Act. \n",
      "The AI-driven revolution, thankfully, is being spearheaded by a newer crop of innovators. Startups like Embibe are using AI to personalize learning journeys, providing granular insights into student performance. Vedantu is blending live teaching with AI-powered assessments, ensuring no child is left behind—or worse, left guessing. Meanwhile, Bengaluru-based Innerscore is exploring AI for skill development, using gamification to keep learners engaged. These tools are designed to empower teachers and students alike, creating dynamic, customized learning spaces tailored to individual needs.\n",
      "For a country as vast and varied as India, AI is almost a necessary lifeline. With 22 official languages and hundreds of dialects, designing a curriculum that works for everyone is a monumental challenge. AI’s ability to personalise solutions at scale makes it the ideal tool for a nation that thrives on diversity. It’s like a tailor stitching a suit for a billion people—fitting every shape, size, and story. \n",
      "And it’s not just about education. In a country that’s part ancient epic, part Silicon Valley pitch deck, AI is the modern equivalent of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, bringing the world’s knowledge to our fingertips while honouring the local nuances that make India, well, India. Government initiatives like DIKSHA and SWAYAM are already leveraging machine learning to digitise school curricula and make quality education accessible to rural students. Public-private partnerships, including those with Microsoft and Google, are aiming to make these benefits trickle down to the last mile.\n",
      "If one were to wander down the philosophical alley, ontologically, AI occupies a unique space—neither living nor inert, neither wholly autonomous nor entirely dependent. If AI is programmed to “think,” does it possess a form of derivative intentionality, or is it merely a reflection of its creator’s design? Epistemologically, it challenges our understanding of knowledge itself. Operating on data-driven logic, AI often generates results that can amaze or baffle human comprehension, making us rethink its limits and dangers. Does its lack of subjective intuition diminish the validity of its insights, or does it offer a new paradigm where truth emerges from patterns beyond individual cognition? In this duality lies AI’s deeper significance—not just as a tool, but as a profound intellectual and philosophical frontier. Its applications in tech and transport are already reshaping our world—autonomous cars, predictive analytics, and smarter cities. But what about the finer things? What can AI do for art, literature, or our universal craving for a good story? This is where AI stops being just useful and starts being interesting.\n",

      "Turning back home—if there’s one thing India has never lacked, it’s a hunger for learning. Education isn’t just a personal pursuit here; it’s a cultural aspiration, a family’s collective dream often built on generations of toil and sacrifice. From ancient gurukuls to the modern IITs, the reverence for knowledge has always been deeply ingrained in our outlooks. Couple that with the lingering echoes of historical struggles—colonial subjugation, poverty, and inequities—and it’s no surprise that today’s India is driven by a fervent desire for progress, autonomy and a higher quality of life.\n",
      "For parents in every corner of the country, from metropolises to villages, the promise of tailored, high-quality education that is a one-way ticket to a better life, is nothing short of a miracle. It’s the digital version of what our ancestors worked toward: better opportunities, stronger foundations, and the ability to rise above circumstances. AI might be cutting-edge technology, but in India, it feels like an age-old promise finally being fulfilled. It represents not just a tool for upward mobility but a symbol of modernity and ambition. \n",
      "Yet, the buzz around it isn’t without its scepticism, and rightly so. Is it still just a hype? Will it perpaps make us all incapable and irrelevant? Questions about affordability, data privacy, and algorithmic biases loom large. Who owns the data these platforms collect? And will AI inadvertently widen the education gap, favouring those who can afford premium services? \n",
      "AI in education isn’t a panacea. No algorithm can replace the empathy of a good teacher or the spontaneity of a classroom debate. But AI can augment these experiences, turning teachers into facilitators of personalised learning and ensuring that no child gets left behind. The onus now lies with policymakers, educators, and innovators to ensure AI serves as an enabler rather than a divider. Regulations must protect user data, and EdTech companies need to be transparent about their algorithms. \n",
      "India is at an inflection point, and the potential of breakthroughs in education technology is enormous. It’s not just about teaching, automating, or optimising—it’s about inspiring, challenging, and delighting. And perhaps many years into the future, even the subtlest chapters in the AI story will matter. In a nation as young and ambitious as ours, it just might be the tool that helps us write a better, brighter future, for one and all.\n",
      "In a recent encounter with a policymaker in education, I was confronted with a staunchly oppositional stance towards integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings. This individual, who admittedly has never engaged with AI technology nor received any formal training on its applications, held a firm belief that AI facilitates academic dishonesty by simplifying the process of completing assignments and projects, thus providing students with what he perceived as an 'unfair advantage'. He nostalgically referenced the rigours of his academic journey, suggesting that his challenges were instrumental to his learning process and character development. Consequently, he argued, today's learners should be allowed to undergo similar hardships. Driven by a conviction that the ease introduced by AI compromises the integrity and value of education, he advocated for a blanket ban on its use within educational institutions. This stance raises pivotal questions about the role of technology in education, the evolution of learning tools over time, and the ethical implications of denying students access to advancements that could enhance their learning experience. These individuals make uninformed decisions that affect teaching and leanring – they do not have the ethos, pathos or logos for their views and actions – the impetus for this article!\n",
      "In the contemporary educational landscape, Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration has emerged as a topic of heated debate, marked by contrasting viewpoints on its utility and impact. As someone deeply entrenched in the dual worlds of AI utilization and the intricacies of the human nervous system, I propose a perspective that champions AI as a significant enabler of productivity and learning rather than a detractor.\n",
      "Spending an average of 3.5 hours daily engaging with AI, I've witnessed firsthand its capacity to enhance productivity. In my roles as an educator and a surgeon familiar with the complexities of neural networks, the parallels between deep neural networks in AI and the intricate workings of the human brain are undeniable. The foundation of AI in deep machine learning mirrors the human brain's neural pathways, presenting an unparalleled opportunity for cognitive and educational advancement.\n",
      "The apprehension that AI will impede learning is a misconception that overlooks the principle of neural plasticity—the brain's ability to adapt to new information and experiences. This fundamental neuroscientific concept supports the argument that our cognitive structures are inherently designed to accommodate and thrive on new learning methods, such as AI's.\n",
      "In my experience, AI is a great enabler, transforming the educational experience by fostering an environment of efficiency and enriched learning. Integrating AI into educational practices empowers learners and educators to leverage these tools for enhanced understanding and engagement. The critical piece, however, is ensuring that all interactions with AI are approached with a mindset geared towards validation and critical thinking.\n",
      "The resistance to AI often stems from a fear of the unknown or a misunderstanding of AI's potential. This fear is unwarranted and counterproductive. AI does not diminish the human capacity for learning; instead, it offers new avenues for exploration and understanding that were previously unimaginable. By encouraging the educational community to embrace AI, we advocate for a future where technology and human intellect coalesce to push the boundaries of what is possible in education.\n",
      "Moreover, banning AI in educational settings raises concerns about inclusivity and justice. Prohibiting AI tools denies learners and educators access to revolutionary technologies that could democratize education, making high-quality learning experiences more accessible to diverse populations. Such actions hinder progress and perpetuate a digital divide that contradicts the principles of equity and inclusion we strive to uphold in educational communities.\n",
      "The challenge, therefore, is not whether to accept AI in education but how to effectively integrate it. This necessitates reevaluating and reinvading assessment methods to align with the capabilities and realities of AI. Educators must awaken to the potential of AI as a tool for enhancing rather than replacing the learning process.\n",
      "In conclusion, as we stand on the precipice of a new education era, let us embrace AI with open arms and minds. By doing so, we commit to a future of inclusive, enriched, and empowered learning. The journey ahead requires adaptability, critical thinking, and a willingness to explore the unknown territories of AI in education.

The stakeholders — educational institutions, students, parents, and employers — must recognise the transformative power of AI and act collectively to harness its benefits. Through a strategic and inclusive approach, India can ensure that its youth are not just participants but leaders in the AI-driven future.\n",
      "Indian policymakers specialised in artificial intelligence (A.I.), who were surveyed by tech giant OpenAI on AI risk perceptions broadly said that threats to education from A.I. are a uniquely high area of concern in India compared to other countries. However, experts within government, industry, and academia told The Hindu that they disagreed with many findings of the OpenAI risk perceptions study. They said that A.I. threats to education are overblown, misplaced, and failed to recognise that the benefits greatly outweigh the dangers in India. \n",
      "OpenAI’s private research conducted between September to December of 2023 through surveys and expert interviews with a few dozen policymakers in five countries found that “Education risks (e.g., students over-relying on AI tools at the expense of critical thinking skills), were viewed as least risky,” but “India is a notable exception: Indian respondents ranked risks to education as the fifth priority area of concern, greater than geopolitical risks or the alignment problem.”\n",
      "No explanation was given in the OpenAI study for why Indian policymakers found A.I. in education risks to be of particularly high concern. OpenAI did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this article.\n",
      "The OpenAI study, which The Hindu exclusively obtained, focused on four broad categories: benefits and risks from A.I., pace of A.I. development, AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and existential risks, and A.I. risk management. The study implicitly focused on cutting edge generative A.I. use cases such as A.I. tools that generate new text, images, videos etc rather than broad uses of artificial intelligence which have existed for many years.\n",
      "OpenAI, the largest and most popular generative A.I. company in the world, found in the study that the greatest dangers from the technology came from “ ‘A.I. misuse/malicious use’ by bad actors and ‘economic risks’ (like job displacement due to automation),” according to policymakers surveyed in five different countries: India, Japan, Taiwan, U.K., and the U.S. \n",
      "On the other hand, OpenAI’s risk perceptions study, which was not released publicly, found that “advanced research and discovery and health advancements,” were identified by survey respondents from all countries as the most beneficial applications of A.I. over the next five years.\n",
      "OpenAI’s private study surveyed 47 policy officials including those within the Indian government, civil society, and A.I. scholars, with a focus on career officials within the Ministries along with the non-governmental entities in India.\n",
      "Advitiya Sharma, chief growth officer of leading EdTech company Schoolnet, disagreed with parts of the OpenAI study findings, highlighting the fundamental issue with generative A.I. use in particular within education in India is the lack of understanding and awareness which creates a lack of confidence and overstates the problems associated with the technology. \n",
      "“We’ve already worked with tens of thousands of teachers and students who have used A.I. in their schools and the benefits outweigh the risks or dangers that exist,” said Sharma who is a serial entrepreneur who previously co-founded Housing.com and founded Genius Teachers, a quiz-based e-learning platform.\n",
      "“The other four countries in the OpenAI study are much more ahead of India regarding their use and understanding of A.I. in education and other fields so there’s bound to be a higher perception of problems in India if it’s not been used much before,” Sharma said. \n",
      "Sharma added that if the OpenAI study were conducted again in 18-24 months, the risk perception of A.I. in education in India would drastically decrease due to widespread use and awareness of the benefits of it as well as the vulnerabilities going down.\n",
      "Some of the specific elements of A.I. policymaking in India that OpenAI conducted its survey about include pitfalls within the education sector as well as the growing optimism and trust that India has placed in public-private cooperation mechanisms.\n",
      "The potential loss of critical reasoning among students due to the use of the technology in education in India is one of the most important considerations and threats, according to Indian educators and policymakers surveyed by OpenAI. \n",
      "For example, thanks to cutting-edge generative A.I. tools, a student may not need to think or reason out a problem because the technology can give them an immediate answer and thereby could cause a decrease in original thinking and problem-solving skills among students. \n",
      "Another potential worry of Indian educators is that if students around the country are using generative A.I. tools like OpenAI’s popular ChatGPT chatbot then schools could face the challenge of testing machine intelligence rather than the students themselves and this could force educators to change the way they assess and test students.\n",
      "“Some challenges definitely exist like when A.I. tools produce incorrect or misleading results but still I’m very optimistic about A.I. in education because it’s great for brainstorming and is a very useful knowledge co-creation tool,” said Krishnan Narayanan, Research Lead at IIT Madras’ Centre for Responsible AI, which is driving a ‘GenAI4Edu’ initiative.\n",
      "“We just have to learn how to design A.I. systems to be Socratic, to get the technology to force students to come up with or be guided to answers themselves rather than giving them the answer automatically,” said Krishnan, an award-winning author of ‘Against All Odds: The IT Story of India’, and former senior executive at Infosys.\n",
      "There are particularly low levels of engagement in learning and education among the vast majority of students in India, according to multiple experts who spoke to The Hindu. Most children fail to do their homework or engage substantively with their course material.\n",
      "This atmosphere creates a unique opportunity for cutting-edge technologies like generative A.I. tools to improve learning outcomes and help students interact positively with their study material, said former Rajya Sabha MP and former BJD party IT and Tech cell head, Amar Patnaik.\n",
      "“A.I. in education is a boon in disguise because it will force and push students to have critical thinking skills and creativity which is sorely lacking in India,” said Patnaik.\n",
      "“The OpenAI study says that A.I. in education could negatively affect students but I think instead that it will make more students interested in learning and therefore school curriculum will need to be changed significantly because of A.I. tools that everyone will and should use,”Patnaik added.\n",
      "Furthermore, some educators say that the technology will force students to learn in a digital-friendly and evidence-based way in the near future.\n",
      "“A.I. systems can be beneficial in education because the more you put into the prompt, the more you explain your understanding of a problem, the better your answer will be from A.I. tools. So we have to see this as an opportunity for educators to use the technology to get students to engage more on subjects that they’re not always interested in,” said Krishnan from IIT Madras.\n",
      "Another potential benefit of A.I. educational tools in India is that they could provide a better, more productive outlet for students to spend their free time, especially in comparison to social media platforms. \n",
      "“With kids spending so much time on their devices and computers, A.I. systems provide a far, far better alternative than social media or other things they do on their devices. It’s far more fruitful for students to use fun educational A.I. tools like ours compared to spending an hour on TikTok or Instagram,” said Sharma from Schoolnet.\n",
      "Nevertheless, educators, politicians, and tech executives say that some thoughtful, carefully considered guardrails and regulations will be needed to successfully implement and use the technology in the long run. \n",
      "“Guardrails for A.I. in education to ensure it’s accurate, unbiased, and helpful have to be taken seriously because students are our future and we need to ensure that they learn the right way,” said Krishnan. \n",
      "“If you don’t expose students to thoughtfully designed generative A.I. educational tools that use a Socratic style and have other checks and balances they will be forced to learn from general A.I. tools and the internet at large which have many existing issues as we know.” Krishnan added.\n",
      "Another challenge is ensuring that the data collected in India to create and run A.l. tools within the educational sector as well as other fields are appropriately gathered and that students don’t blindly follow the output of the technology.\n",
      "“A.I. biases baked into the current data sets are a big issue. So if you’re making decisions based on flawed or biased data sets and their corresponding A.I. tools, there will be worse or problematic actions taken,”said Patnaik, the former Rajya Sabha member.\n",
      "“In the Indian context, as a civil servant and public official, I have the experience to know that we cannot create A.I. systems that are built only upon data collected through formal official channels such as government records, consumer purchases, online behavior, etc. because a lot of insights and answers to problems in India come through informal data channels from entities like street vendors, labourers, unskilled workers, and others in informal sectors,” Patnaik added.\n",
      "Although potential A.I. risks to education in India were highlighted in the OpenAI study, major concerns around other prominent use cases of the technology deserve just as much or more attention in the coming months, according to some tech-policy experts like Krishnan from IIT-Madras and Patnaik, the former Rajya Sabha member.\n",
      "Krishnan said he was surprised that the results of OpenAI’s risk perception survey didn’t highlight threats like the role of A.I. in the military and warfare while Patnaik said he would have expected the study to highlight how the technology could be used negatively or positively to impact climate change.\n",
      "EdTech executives like Sharma from Schoolnet say that the future of A.I. in education is full of excitement and innovation because of the potential to democratise and scale access to world-class educational tools across India including among the poorest schools and students.\n",
      "“Soon we will have an A.I. avatar or teacher trained on Einstein, Aristotle, Tagore, you know the best of the best, and every student then gets access to a genius teacher,” said Sharma. \n",
      "“For example, if a student gets stuck on a problem or has a complicated question, they can turn to an A.I. chatbot that gives outputs similar to that of Einstein or other world-renowned thinkers. We have such an A.I. application currently in an early beta stage of testing but has been rolled out with some success in a few Jharkhand government schools and of course the more users and the more data you feed the technology, the better it gets.”\n"
